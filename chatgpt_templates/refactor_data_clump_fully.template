I will provide you ${programming_language} code files.
Data clumps can be either on method parameter level or on field level.
Locate all method and field definitions where data clumps exist.
The data clumps can be extracted to a new class. E.g. if multiple times the parameters x,y,z appear, a class 'Point' can be created instead.
Please try to find at least 5 different data clumps
Output in JSON with the format given below.
Disregard a JSON object if the code is not a field definition or a method definition but the usage of a field or method.
