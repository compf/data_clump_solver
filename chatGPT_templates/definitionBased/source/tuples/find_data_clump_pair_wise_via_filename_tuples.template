I will provide you ${programming_language} code files.
After that, I will provide you tuples of file names. A tuple may consists of two file names or only one file name. For each tuple I provide, find all data clumps in the respective files.

A data clump exists if
1) two methods (in the same or in different classes) have at least 3 common parameters
    and one of those methods does not override the other,

or  
2) At least three fields in a class are common with the parameters of a method (in the same or in a different class),

or
3) Two different classes have at least three common fields


Use the following JSON format for the output:
## JSON
${output_format}
