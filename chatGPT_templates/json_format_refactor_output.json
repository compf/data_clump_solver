I require a full, detailed refactoring of the entire code. Do not omit methods for brevity  and do not omit unchanged methods
 because I will replace the original file with your output

{
    "<filePath1>": "<full content of the file 1>",
    "<filePath2>": "<full content of the file 2>",
    //...
}
