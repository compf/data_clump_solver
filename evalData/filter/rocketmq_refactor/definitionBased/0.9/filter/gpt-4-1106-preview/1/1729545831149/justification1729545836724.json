  "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is a set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) that appears across two methods in the same class, ConsumerLagCalculator. Since these methods are closely related to consuming lag metrics calculation and they share a common domain (related to message queue statistics), it indicates a high degree of coupling around the concept of a 'consumer lag'. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class could greatly reduce duplication, simplify method signatures, and improve code readability and maintenance.",
