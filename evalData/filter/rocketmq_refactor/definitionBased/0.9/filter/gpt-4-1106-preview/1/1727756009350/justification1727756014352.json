  "key": "0",
  "reason": "size",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key '0' has a large number of common fields (at least three) between two classes, which points towards significant duplication. Given that this clump is widespread and impacts multiple metrics and statistics-related features, refactoring could lead to a more maintainable and extendable codebase. Abstracting these fields into a coherent class would encapsulate related data points, improve maintainability, and potentially simplify the interaction between 'Stats' and 'BrokerStatsManager' classes."
