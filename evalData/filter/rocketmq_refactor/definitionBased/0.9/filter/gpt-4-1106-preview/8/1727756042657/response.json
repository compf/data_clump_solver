    "key": "26",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 26 is selected because it shows a significant number of field duplications between two different classes in the same module 'client'. The presence of these fields in both the 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl' classes suggests a high level of duplication, which likely indicates these classes are performing similar or related tasks. Refactoring these common fields into a shared class or a superclass could reduce the duplication, simplify the design, and facilitate maintenance and future extensions. This could also help in ensuring any changes to the shared logic need to be made in just one place. Given the potential for frequent usage of these consumer classes by client applications, addressing this data clump could have a significant positive impact on the client module's robustness and reduce the risk of errors or inconsistencies."
