    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 0 is chosen due to its large number of common fields (25 fields) spread across two classes within different files (Stats.java and BrokerStatsManager.java). This significant number of shared fields implies a high level of duplication and could indicate that these fields are conceptually related, representing an aspect of the domain that might be better modelled as a separate class. Refactoring this clump could reduce duplication, improve code readability, enhance maintainability, and create an abstraction that better represents the underlying domain model."
