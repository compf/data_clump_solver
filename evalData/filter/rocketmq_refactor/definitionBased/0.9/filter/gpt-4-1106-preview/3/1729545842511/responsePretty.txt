    "justification":"Data clump key 0 consists of multiple public static final fields that are common between two classes in separate modules (common and store). The occurrence of these string constants across classes suggests that they are used frequently throughout the codebase and are related to statistics management. Refactoring this clump into a single 'StatsConstants' class or similar construct would centralize the management of these constants and reduce the redundancy, making the system easier to maintain and understand. Any future changes to these constants would require a single point of update, thereby reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.",
