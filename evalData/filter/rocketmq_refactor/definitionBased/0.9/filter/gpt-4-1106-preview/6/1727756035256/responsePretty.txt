    "justification":"The data clump in key 0 involves a very large number of variables (25 in total), which indicates a significant amount of duplication and suggests that these fields are likely used together in multiple places. Refactoring this clump by creating a new class or struct to encapsulate these fields could greatly reduce code duplication, improve readability, and make it easier to maintain and modify the related functionality in the future."
