    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 contains fields that appear to be related to consumer implementation details of a messaging system. These fields seem to share a common domain, indicating a potential consumer context or configuration. Refactoring these fields into a separate class could increase the cohesion of the consumer classes by encapsulating consumer-related configuration and hooks. Creating a class that represents consumer settings or context could also facilitate code maintenance and readability by providing a clear structure for consumer-related operations.",
