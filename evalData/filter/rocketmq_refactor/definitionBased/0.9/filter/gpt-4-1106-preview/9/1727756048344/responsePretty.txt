    "justification": "Data clump with key 0 has the largest number of common fields, indicating a high level of duplication and complexity. This data clump includes a large set of constants that are used across different classes, which suggests that these values are part of a common domain and could be better managed if extracted into a separate configuration class or enumeration. This would lead to cleaner, more maintainable code and reduce the risk of inconsistency."
