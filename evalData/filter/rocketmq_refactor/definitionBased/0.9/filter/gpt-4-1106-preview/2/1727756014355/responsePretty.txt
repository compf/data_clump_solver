This data clump was chosen because it involves a large number of fields (25 identified fields) that are common between two classes, suggesting that these classes are tightly coupled around a shared set of constants representing stats. Refactoring this data clump may significantly improve the modularity of the code by moving these constants into a shared class or enum. Such a refactoring would simplify future changes to these constants and potentially reduce the risk of errors when they are used across different parts of the system.
