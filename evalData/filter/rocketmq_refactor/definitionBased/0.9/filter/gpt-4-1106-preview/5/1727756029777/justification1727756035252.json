  "justification": "This data clump has a very large number of fields (25 in total) that are common between two classes. The large number of common fields suggests a high level of duplication and indicates that these fields are likely to represent a common concept or domain that could benefit from being abstracted into a separate class. Refactoring this data clump into an independent class could greatly improve modularity, maintainability, and reusability of the code."
