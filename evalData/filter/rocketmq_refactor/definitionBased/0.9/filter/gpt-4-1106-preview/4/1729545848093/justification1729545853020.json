  "key": "75",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 75 involves parameter duplication between two methods 'getMessage' and 'getMessageFromRemoteAsync' in the 'EscapeBridge' class. This duplication suggests that these parameters are frequently used together in this context, which indicates a strong case for encapsulating them into a single object. By doing this, we could improve code maintainability and reduce the risk of errors when these methods are modified or expanded upon in the future.",
