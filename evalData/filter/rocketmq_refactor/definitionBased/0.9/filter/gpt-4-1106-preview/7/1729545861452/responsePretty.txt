    "justification": "Given the large number of fields that are common across two classes (Stats and BrokerStatsManager), it is apparent that there is a domain concept that has not been encapsulated into a class. This data clump appears to represent metrics or statistics identifiers that are used across these classes to access or modify statistics related to messaging operations. Refactoring this data clump is critical to minimize the risk of errors when maintaining the code, improve clarity by introducing a new class that represents this concept, and facilitate any future changes to the metrics or statistics management.",
