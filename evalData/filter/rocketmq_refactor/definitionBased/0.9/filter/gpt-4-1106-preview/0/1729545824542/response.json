    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 has a significant number of common fields (25 fields) used across two different classes, Stats and BrokerStatsManager. This data clump is not only large but also suggests that these fields are likely related and represent a single concept or dataset within the domain of the application. By refactoring this clump into a separate class, code comprehension and maintainability could greatly be improved. The benefits include reducing the parameter lists on methods, making the codebase more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and encapsulating related behavior that operates on these fields.",
