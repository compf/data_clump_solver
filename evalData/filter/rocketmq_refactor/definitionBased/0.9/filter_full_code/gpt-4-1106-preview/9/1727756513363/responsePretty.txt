justification:"
The `DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl` class has a large number of fields, many of which are related to configuration and threading. This creates high coupling and complexity when initializing, starting, or configuring the consumer. Refactoring could improve readability, maintainability, and testability by extracting related fields and behaviors into separate classes, such as configuration handling or thread pool management.
