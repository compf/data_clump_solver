justification:"
The `ConsumerLagCalculator` class is responsible for calculating consumer lag, which is a key metric indicating how far behind a consumer group is in processing messages. This domain-specific class integrates multiple components such as `BrokerConfig`, `TopicConfigManager`, `ConsumerManager`, `ConsumerOffsetManager`, `ConsumerFilterManager`, `SubscriptionGroupManager`, `MessageStore`, `PopBufferMergeService`, and `PopInflightMessageCounter` to provide comprehensive metrics about consumer lag. Extracting this data clump into a dedicated class encapsulates the domain of consumer lag calculation, improves code readability, and facilitates potential extensions and maintenance related to consumer lag monitoring.
