    "justification":"The provided code snippet contains a method 'operateAfterRunning()' which seems quite extensive. It contains multiple conditional logic blocks and loop constructs. This not only makes the method longer but also increases its complexity, which might affect readability and maintainability. Extracting certain blocks or steps into separate, well-named methods could improve code comprehension and testability.",
