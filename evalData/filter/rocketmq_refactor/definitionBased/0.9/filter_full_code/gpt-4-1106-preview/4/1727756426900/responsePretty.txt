    "justification":"The 'BrokerConfig' object contains a series of configuration settings related to the broker component in RocketMQ such as time-based configurations (e.g., 'registerBrokerTimeoutMills', 'sendHeartbeatTimeoutMillis'), enabling or disabling certain features (e.g., 'slaveReadEnable', 'disableConsumeIfConsumerReadSlowly', 'brokerFastFailureEnable'), and threshold settings (e.g., 'consumerFallbehindThreshold'). These configurations are all related to how the broker behaves within the messaging system domain, making this a domain-related data clump. Refactoring this into a separate class can provide a more coherent and isolated configuration object within the domain of broker settings."
