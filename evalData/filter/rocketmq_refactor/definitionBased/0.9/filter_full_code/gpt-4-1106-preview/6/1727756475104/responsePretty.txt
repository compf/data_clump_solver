    "reason": "size",
    "justification": "The class 'Stats' contains a large number of string constants representing different statistics fields, such as queue put numbers, queue get size, broker put numbers, etc. The presence of such a substantial number of related string constants in a single class indicates that these constants could potentially be grouped into a more cohesive structure. Extracting these constants into a class that encapsulates the concept of statistics related to queuing, topics, and brokers could improve code organization, readability, and reduce the risk of string constant duplication across different parts of the codebase."
