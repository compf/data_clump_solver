    "justification":"This data clump presents a recurring pattern where several fields related to RocketMQ's configuration are grouped together across different classes. It's identified because several classes configure RocketMQ and need to access these properties, leading to duplicated code. Extracting them into a class would reduce duplication, improving maintainability and allowing centralized configuration changes.",
