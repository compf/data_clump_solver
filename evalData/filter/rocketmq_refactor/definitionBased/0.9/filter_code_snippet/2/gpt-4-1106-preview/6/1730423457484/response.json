    "justification":"The data clump consisting of pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException, PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL, and PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL appears in multiple classes 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl'. These fields are related to the pull delay configuration indicating the consumer's behavior upon different events. Since the occurrence of this data clump is high across different classes, it leads to code duplication and potential inconsistencies in managing these settings. The refactoring would promote better maintainability and would enable centralized control of these parameters.",
