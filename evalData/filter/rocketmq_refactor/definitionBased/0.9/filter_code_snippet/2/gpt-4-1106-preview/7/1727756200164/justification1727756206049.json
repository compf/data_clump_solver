  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is the most critical to refactor due to its high occurrence number. With 3558 occurrences spread across 32 different files, this clump suggests a widespread replication of method signatures with common parameters. Such a significant amount of duplication can lead to maintenance challenges, inconsistencies in code changes, and an increased potential for errors when modifying any method that is part of this clump. By isolating these parameters into a separate class or structuring them more cohesively, we can greatly reduce code duplication and improve the maintainability and readability of the codebase."
