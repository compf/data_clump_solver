    "justification": "The constants defined in `Stats.java` are duplicated as deprecated in `BrokerStatsManager.java`, which affects multiple files and leads to unnecessary duplication. Refactoring this data clump by ensuring a single source of truth for these constants removes the deprecated duplicates and reduces the risk of divergence between the two files. It simplifies the codebase and makes it easier to maintain.",
