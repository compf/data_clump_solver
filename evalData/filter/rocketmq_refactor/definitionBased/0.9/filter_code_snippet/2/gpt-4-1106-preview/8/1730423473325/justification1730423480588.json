  "justification": "The data clump with the combination of parameters 'String topic, int queueId, long offset' in methods across ConsumerLagCalculator and EscapeBridge classes indicates that these parameters are often used together in multiple methods. This frequent combination suggests that there is a common concept or entity in the domain that should be encapsulated in its class. The use of these parameters in various methods across classes also makes the code less maintainable and more prone to errors when changes are required. By extracting these parameters into a class, we can improve the clarity of the code and reduce the risk of introducing bugs when modifying code related to message consumption and offset management.",
