    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 26 consists of several constants and variables related to flow control and exception handling, such as `pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException`, `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL`, and `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL`. This clump is crucial because it is closely related to the domain of consumer behavior, as it dictates how the consumer reacts to various states of the system, such as cache being full or broker flow control. Refactoring this clump into its own class could encapsulate the domain logic regarding consumer timing and delays, making it easier to manage and understand.",
