    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "While the size of the common parameters is not the largest, the high frequency of occurrence (3558 times across 32 files) indicates significant duplication of code involving the parameters 'group', 'topic', 'queueId'. This can lead to maintenance issues, increase the likelihood of bugs during updates, and create unnecessary complexity. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or a method would greatly reduce duplication and improve the manageability of the codebase."
