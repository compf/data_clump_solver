  "key": "26",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The key 26 represents long-valued timeout and delay fields like 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL', which are commonly used for flow control and exception handling in different classes related to consumer implementations. These fields occur multiple times across different classes, indicating a recurring pattern that would benefit from refactoring to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
