    "justification": "The selected data clump (key: 59) is identified based on its very high occurrence. It occurs 3558 times across 32 affected files, which suggests that this particular clump leads to a significant amount of duplication in the codebase. Refactoring this data clump can greatly reduce code redundancy and improve maintainability. The parameters group, topic, queueId (and sometimes isPop) are likely related to messaging domain concepts, but the high occurrence makes this a priority for refactoring regardless of the domain."
