    "justification": "This data clump is chosen because it has a very high occurrence (3558 times), which indicates a significant amount of duplication across many files (32 affected files). By addressing this data clump, we can greatly reduce the code duplication, decrease the potential for errors, and enhance the maintainability of the codebase. Refactoring out this data clump into a separate abstraction can provide a cleaner, more reusable interface for obtaining consumer lag statistics."
