    "key": "26",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by the key '26' consists of repeated declarations of constants and properties that are related to time and flow control in multiple consumer-related classes. These constants define time delays for exception handling, cache flow control, and broker flow control. The data clump occurs across at least three different files (`DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl.java`, `DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl.java`, and `BrokerStatsManager.java`), implying duplication of code for similar tasks.",
