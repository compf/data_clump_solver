    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen due to its high frequency of occurrence (60 times) across a large number of files (32 files). High occurrence indicates a pervasive pattern of duplicate code which can lead to increased maintenance efforts and a higher chance of introducing bugs when changes are made. Refactoring this data clump into a cohesive class would greatly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase.",
