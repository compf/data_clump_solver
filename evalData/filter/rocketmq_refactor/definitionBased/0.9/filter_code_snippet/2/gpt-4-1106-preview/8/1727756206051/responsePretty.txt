    "justification": "The data clump identified with key 59 has a very high occurrence (3558 times) in the codebase and affects 32 different files. This suggests that there is substantial duplication associated with it, which could greatly benefit from refactoring. By introducing a new object or method to encapsulate these repeated patterns, the codebase can be made more maintainable, and changes to this common functionality would be centralized, making the system easier to understand and modify."
