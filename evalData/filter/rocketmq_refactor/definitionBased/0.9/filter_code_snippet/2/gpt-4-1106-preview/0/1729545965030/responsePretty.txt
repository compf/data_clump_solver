    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The methods in the 'ConsumerLagCalculator' class contain a data clump consisting of the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId', which occur 60 times across 32 different files. This indicates that the parameters are tightly coupled and are used together very frequently, leading to significant duplication of code. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class can greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
