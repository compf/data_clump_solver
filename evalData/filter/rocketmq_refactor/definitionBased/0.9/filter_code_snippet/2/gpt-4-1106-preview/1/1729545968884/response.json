    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count across multiple files (60 occurrences affecting 32 files), leading to substantial duplication and making it a prime candidate for refactoring. The common parameters (group, topic, queueId) suggest a natural domain for abstraction into a class that encapsulates the consumer lag statistics concept, which can improve code readability and reduce the potential for errors during further development.",
