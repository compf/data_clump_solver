  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is chosen because it occurs very often (3558 occurrences), which indicates a high level of duplication and repetitive code across 32 affected files. This can greatly increase the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to maintain and more prone to errors. Refactoring this data clump can significantly improve the maintainability and cleanliness of the code."
