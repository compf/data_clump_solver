  "justification": "The selected data clump is based on its high occurrence which indicates significant duplication throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump can lead to a more maintainable and less error-prone code, as it affects 32 files with 60 occurrences. This high frequency of the same parameter set being passed around increases the risk of bugs when making changes and makes the code harder to understand. By extracting these parameters into a single class, we can encapsulate the related behavior and improve code cohesion.",
