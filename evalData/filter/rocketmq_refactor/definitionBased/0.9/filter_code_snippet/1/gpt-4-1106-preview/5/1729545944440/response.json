    "justification": "The methods getConsumerLagStats and calculateMessageCount in ConsumerLagCalculator.java share common parameters (group, topic, and queueId) and have a high occurrence of being used 60 times across 32 files. This repeated use across multiple files indicates a significant amount of code duplication, which would benefit greatly from refactoring into a single class to encapsulate these common parameters and reduce duplication.",
