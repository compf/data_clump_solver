  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has been identified as the most important for refactoring due to its high frequency of occurrence, with a total of 60 instances across 32 affected files. This frequent repetition suggests that the combination of parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' is a core concept in the application that is being passed around extensively. Refactoring this data clump into a class can greatly reduce code duplication, increase maintainability, and improve the ability to make future changes to this core concept with minimal impact on the overall system.",
