justification:"
The data clump with key 59 in the ConsumerLagCalculator class has the highest reported occurrence count (3558 times), which indicates significant duplication and is found across 32 affected files, suggesting that it is a widespread issue in the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would improve maintainability and reduce the potential for errors. By introducing a new class or method that encapsulates the parameters (group, topic, queueId), it would simplify the method interfaces and centralize common logic, likely yielding a high impact on the overall code quality.
