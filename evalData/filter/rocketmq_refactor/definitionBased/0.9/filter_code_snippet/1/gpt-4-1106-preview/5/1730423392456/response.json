    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 26 is present in multiple classes within the 'client' package, specifically in 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl'. This duplication of fields such as 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL', 'queueFlowControlTimes', and 'queueMaxSpanFlowControlTimes' suggests these fields are related and likely to change together. Refactoring these fields into a separate class would reduce duplication and create a more maintainable and coherent structure for these consumer configuration settings.",
