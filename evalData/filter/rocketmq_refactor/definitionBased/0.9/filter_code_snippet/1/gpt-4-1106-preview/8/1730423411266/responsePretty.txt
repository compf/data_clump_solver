    "justification": "Several fields in two different classes (`DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl` and `DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl`) are related to pull time delay, queue flow control, and various other configurations which are exact duplicates (pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException, PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL, PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL, queueFlowControlTimes, queueMaxSpanFlowControlTimes). These fields are used in similar contexts within multiple classes, constituting a data clump due to their high occurrence across consumer implementations which creates unnecessary code duplication.",
