    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is selected because it has the highest occurrence count, leading to a substantial amount of duplication across multiple files. Since the data clump appears 60 times in 32 different files, refactoring it would not only decrease duplication but would also improve maintainability and consistency across those many instances. Furthermore, focusing on a data clump with such widespread occurrence is likely to have a beneficial impact on a larger portion of the codebase compared to data clumps with a lower occurrence count.",
