    "justification": "This data clump is chosen for refactoring due to the high number of occurrences which indicate widespread duplication in various methods. The methods 'getConsumerLagStats' and 'calculateMessageCount' and other similar methods in the 'ConsumerLagCalculator' class with the data clump comprising the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' occur 3558 times across 32 affected files. Reducing this duplication by creating a new construct to encapsulate these common parameters would greatly improve code maintainability and reduce the likelihood of errors when these parameters are used in the future."
