    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump key 59 with the method signatures `getConsumerLagStats(String group, String topic, int queueId, boolean isPop)` and `calculateMessageCount(String group, String topic, int queueId, long from, long to)` occurs a very high number of times - 3558 occurrences across 32 affected files. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication throughout many classes and methods, suggesting that refactoring this clump would potentially reduce code duplication significantly and improve maintainability."
