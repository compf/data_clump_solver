  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has the highest occurrence count (3558) amongst the provided options. The parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are shared across multiple methods, which are being used very frequently. Refactoring this data clump would likely reduce duplicate code effectively across these high-frequency methods, leading to a more maintainable and clearer codebase. Extracting these common parameters into a single class or structure could prevent errors and increase consistency when these values are passed between methods, and also simplify method signatures, enhancing readability."
