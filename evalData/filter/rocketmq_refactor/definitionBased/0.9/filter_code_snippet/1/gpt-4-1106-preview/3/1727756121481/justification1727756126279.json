  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with the key '59' is repeatedly occurring 3558 times across 32 files. This high frequency of occurrence suggests that these parameters are a central part of the system's operation and refactoring this clump could potentially reduce a significant amount of duplication. The impact of these changes could lead to better maintainability and understandability of the system since these parameters appear to be related to fetching and calculating consumer lag statistics."
