  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "Choosing the data clump with the key '59' is justified due to the high number of occurrences, which is 60. This indicates there's significant repetition of these same variables across various parts of the code, leading to code duplication and potential inconsistency. Refactoring this clump would greatly reduce duplication and simplify maintenance.",
