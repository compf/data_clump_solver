The data clump with key 59 is the most important one to refactor because it leads to a significant amount of duplication with 3558 occurrences, affecting 32 different files. This magnitude of repetition suggests that these common fields are a core part of the system's operations and refactoring them into a single cohesive unit would greatly reduce complexity, improve readability, and simplify future maintenance and extension of the code base.
