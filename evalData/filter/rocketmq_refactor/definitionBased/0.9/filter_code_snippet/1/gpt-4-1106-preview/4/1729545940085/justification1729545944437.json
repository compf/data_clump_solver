  "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is found in the methods getConsumerLagStats and calculateMessageCount across different parts of the code with a high occurrence of 60 times. This indicates that the group of parameters (String group, String topic, int queueId) is frequently used together in business logic, which creates a high potential for code duplication and complexity that may benefit from refactoring into a shared class.",
