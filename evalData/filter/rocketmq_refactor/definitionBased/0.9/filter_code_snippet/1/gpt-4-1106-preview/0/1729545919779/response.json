    "justification":"The data clump with key '59' appears the most often with 60 occurrences, and is also spread across a large number of files (affected_files: 32). This suggests it leads to a significant amount of duplication. Its small size (size: 3) indicates that it's a concise set of variables that are repeatedly used together, making it an ideal candidate for refactoring into its own class to encapsulate the common behavior and properties, hence reducing duplication and improving the maintainability of the codebase.",
