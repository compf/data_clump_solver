    "justification": "The selected data clump, with the key 59, represents a set of parameters (group, topic, and queueId) used across multiple methods that occur a very high number of times in the codebase (3558 occurrences). The high number of occurrences suggests that these parameters are a fundamental part of the logic and likely lead to significant code duplication. Refactoring this data clump into a single cohesive unit, such as a class or structure, could greatly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code by centralizing the common logic related to these parameters."
