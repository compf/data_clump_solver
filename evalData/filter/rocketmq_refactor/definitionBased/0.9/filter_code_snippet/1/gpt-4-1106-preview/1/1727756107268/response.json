    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is selected because it has a very high occurrence (3558 times), which indicates a substantial amount of duplication across the codebase. This suggests that there may be a tight coupling around the logic of consumer lag statistics, which could benefit significantly from refactoring into a more cohesive structure. This would likely improve maintainability and readability by centralizing the consumer lag calculation logic, thus reducing the duplicated code."
