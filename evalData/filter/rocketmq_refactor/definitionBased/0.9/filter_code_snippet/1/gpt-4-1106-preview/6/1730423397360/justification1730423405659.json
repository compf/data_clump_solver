  "justification": "The data clump related to broker configuration (i.e., 'brokerConfigPath', 'namesrvAddr', 'regionId', 'traceOn', several metrics-related configurations) is found across multiple classes and configuration files (BrokerConfig.java and ProxyConfig.java). This pervasive spread across multiple files increases the risk of errors due to the need to change the same information in multiple places. It also indicates that these settings are key parts of the configuration domain and are likely to be modified together, suggesting that they would benefit from being encapsulated in their own class.",
