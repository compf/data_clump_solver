justification:"
I chose this data clump because it has the highest number of occurrences (3558), affecting 32 different files, which indicates that it causes significant duplication throughout the codebase. This widespread duplication could result in a maintenance burden and make future changes more error-prone. By refactoring this data clump, we can enhance the maintainability and clarity of the code, and reduce the risk of inconsistencies or bugs when these common fields need to be updated or used consistently.
