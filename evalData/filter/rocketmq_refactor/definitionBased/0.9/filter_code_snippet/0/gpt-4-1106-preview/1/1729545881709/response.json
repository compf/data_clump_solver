    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60 and affects 32 files. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication that can lead to errors and reduce maintainability. Refactoring such a commonly repeated clump will likely have a significant positive impact on the codebase by reducing code repetition, improving readability, and making future changes easier to implement.",
