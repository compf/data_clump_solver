    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 was chosen due to its high occurrence, appearing 60 times across 32 files, signifying extensive duplication of the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId'. Refactoring this data clump would not only reduce code duplication but also likely improve the maintainability and readability of the code by centralizing these parameters into a single cohesive structure.",
