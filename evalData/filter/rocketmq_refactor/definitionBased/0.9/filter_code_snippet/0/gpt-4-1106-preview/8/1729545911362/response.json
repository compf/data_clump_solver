    "justification": "The data clump with key '59' is chosen because it occurs 60 times, causing significant duplication across the codebase. This indicates that many parts of the system are repetitively using the same group of variables ('group', 'topic', 'queueId'), which can lead to maintenance difficulties and increase the risk of errors when multiple instances of the same data structure are being manipulated separately.",
