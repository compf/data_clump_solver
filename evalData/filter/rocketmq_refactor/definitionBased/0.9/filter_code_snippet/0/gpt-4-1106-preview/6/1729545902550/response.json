    "key": 59,
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence. It is used in at least 32 different files and appears 60 times in the codebase. This indicates a significant amount of duplication and tightly coupled code, making maintenance difficult. Refactoring this data clump into a class or structure should reduce the coupling and make the code more modular, improving maintainability and reducing the chance of errors when changes are made.",
