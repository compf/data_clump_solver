    "justification": "This data clump is selected due to its high occurrence and impact on a significant number of files (32 affected files with 3558 occurrences). High-frequency code duplication like this indicates that a large portion of the codebase could be made cleaner and more maintainable through refactoring. Introducing a new class or method to encapsulate these repeated parameters can greatly reduce code duplication and improve readability throughout the project."
