    "justification": "This data clump is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes (DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl and DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl). Both classes have several common fields which are likely to be related to the configuration of the consumer, such as hooks, service state, and timing configurations. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class can promote better encapsulation, reuse, and reduce the chance of inconsistent changes in the future.",
