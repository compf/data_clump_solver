    "justification": "The data clump present in the BrokerConfig and ProxyConfig classes has three common fields (`namesrvAddr`, `brokerConfigPath`, and `traceOn`), along with several other configurations that are similar between the classes. These are basic configurations that are crucial for the operation of both the broker and the proxy components of the system. Having these configuration fields repeated in multiple classes across different modules can lead to errors when making changes, as the changes need to be replicated in all places. By refactoring this data clump, we can ensure that the configuration is consistent across the system and reduce the risk of errors.",
