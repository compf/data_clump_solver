    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 corresponds to configuration properties that are replicated in different classes across multiple packages ('common', 'proxy'). The repeated occurrence of these properties across different files indicates that they are integral to the configuration aspect of the system and would benefit from refactoring into a single source of truth. By extracting these shared properties into a single configuration class or structure, we can reduce the chance of inconsistencies, improve maintainability, and make it easier to extend configuration changes across the system.",
