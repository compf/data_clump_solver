    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The selected data clump (key: 59) represents parameters that are frequently repeated across a significant number of method calls (3558 occurrences) and affects a large number of files (32). This repeated pattern indicates a high level of duplication, which can lead to maintainability issues and increases the risk of bugs when changes are made. Refactoring this data clump into a single cohesive structure would likely result in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase."
