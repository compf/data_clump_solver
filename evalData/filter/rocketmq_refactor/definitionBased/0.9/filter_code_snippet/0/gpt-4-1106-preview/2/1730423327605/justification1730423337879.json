  "key": "26",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is selected due to its high occurrence, as it appears multiple times across different classes within the 'client' package. This high frequency of repetition suggests redundancy and potential for simplification through refactoring. By introducing a new class that encapsulates these common fields, you can reduce duplication, improve code clarity, and make the codebase easier to maintain. The fields in this clump are related to consumer configuration, logging, and message handling, which are core aspects of the client's functionality in a messaging system like RocketMQ.",
