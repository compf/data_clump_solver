  "justification": "The configuration properties related to metrics exporter and other settings are repeated across different configuration classes (`BrokerConfig` and `ProxyConfig`). Refactoring these common fields into a reusable class would significantly reduce duplication and simplify future changes to the configuration properties across multiple modules. This would improve maintainability and consistency within the codebase.",
