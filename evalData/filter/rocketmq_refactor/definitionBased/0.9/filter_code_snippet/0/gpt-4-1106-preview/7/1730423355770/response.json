    "justification": "Configuration properties such as 'namesrvAddr', 'brokerConfigPath', 'regionId', 'traceOn', 'metricsGrpcExporterTarget', and others related to metrics and exporters are repeated across multiple classes 'BrokerConfig' and 'ProxyConfig', indicating these values are shared between different components. Refactoring these into a common configuration class can reduce duplication and facilitate easier maintenance, especially for properties that are likely to be changed together.",
