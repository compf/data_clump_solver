    "justification":"This data clump is chosen because of its high occurrence, suggesting significant duplication across the codebase. Refactoring this clump would not only improve maintainability but also reduce the risk of inconsistent changes across multiple locations. It appears that the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are related to consumer statistics and their usages are spread across 32 affected files with 60 occurrences, making this a prime candidate for refactoring into a single class that can be reused throughout the code.",
