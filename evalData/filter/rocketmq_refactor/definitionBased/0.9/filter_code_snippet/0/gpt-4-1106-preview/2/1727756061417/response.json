    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 appears in 32 affected_files and has a high occurrence rate of 3558 instances. This suggests that there is a substantial amount of code duplication spread across numerous files. Refactoring this clump would greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability, especially considering the high frequency with which these parameters are used together."
