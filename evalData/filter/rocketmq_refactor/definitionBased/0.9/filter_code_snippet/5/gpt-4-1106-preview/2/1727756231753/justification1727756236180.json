  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "While all data clumps may be refactored to improve the codebase, the data clump with key 59 is chosen here due to its high frequency of occurrence (3558 occurrences across 32 affected files). This high frequency suggests that the data clump is deeply ingrained in the system and refactoring it could lead to a significant reduction in code duplication and potential for errors. Additionally, addressing such a pervasive data clump could improve maintainability and clarity of the codebase significantly."
