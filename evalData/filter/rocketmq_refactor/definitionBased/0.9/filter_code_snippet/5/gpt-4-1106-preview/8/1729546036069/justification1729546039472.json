  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has been chosen because it occurs 60 times across 32 files, indicating that this set of parameters is used very frequently and is spread across a large portion of the codebase, leading to significant code duplication. Refactoring this clump can greatly reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and possibly uncover additional design issues that can be addressed.",
