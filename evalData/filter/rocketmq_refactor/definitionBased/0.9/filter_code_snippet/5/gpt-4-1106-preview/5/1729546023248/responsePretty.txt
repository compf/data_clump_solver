    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is chosen for refactoring due to its high occurrence rate. This clump appears 60 times and is spread across 32 affected files, which indicates a significant amount of duplication and widespread impact in the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely improve the maintainability and readability of the code by consolidating the repeated parameters into a single cohesive concept. Furthermore, by extracting these parameters into a separate class or struct, the code would become more modular, with the potential to simplify method signatures and reduce the possibility of errors when passing around related data.",
