    "justification":"I chose the data clump with key 59 because it has the highest occurrence across the affected files. This indicates that the code duplication due to the data clump is rampant and could lead to higher maintenance costs as well as potential bugs due to inconsistency. Refactoring this code to use a single class to encapsulate the common fields would significantly reduce repetition and improve code readability.",
