    "key": 59,
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 occurs 60 times across 32 affected files, indicating that it is a recurring pattern that may lead to a significant amount of duplication. This high occurrence across multiple files strongly suggests that these variables are highly coupled and represent a concept that is repeatedly used throughout the application. By refactoring this data clump, we can potentially reduce the risk of errors, improve code maintainability, and make future changes easier to apply.",
