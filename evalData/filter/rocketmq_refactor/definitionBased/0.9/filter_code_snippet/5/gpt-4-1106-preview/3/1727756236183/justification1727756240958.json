  "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has a significant number of occurrences (3558) across numerous files (32), suggesting that refactoring it would reduce duplication and improve maintainability across a large section of the codebase. This commonality is spread across different methods and classes, highlighting the clump's potential impact on the system's architecture. By addressing this clump, we could centralize related logic, simplify method signatures, and make future changes easier and less error-prone."
