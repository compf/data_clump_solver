justification:"
The data clump identified by key 59 has the highest number of occurrences (3558), indicating that it is a pattern that is being repeated across many parts of the codebase. This repetition suggests that refactoring this data clump could significantly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code. Furthermore, it affects a considerable number of files (32), which means that the potential impact of addressing this issue is broad, likely leading to a cleaner and more organized code structure.
