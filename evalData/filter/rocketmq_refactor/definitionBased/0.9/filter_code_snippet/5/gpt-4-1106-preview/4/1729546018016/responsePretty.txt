    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "Data clump with key 59 is chosen because it has the highest occurrence (60 times) across the most files (32), indicating extensive duplication and a high impact on the codebase. This clump involves method parameters (group, topic, queueId) which are highly related to each other, indicating domain significance and the likelihood that these parameters are used together in the context of message consumption or production. Extracting these into a class would not only reduce duplication but also improve the semantic representation of the domain model, making the code more understandable.",
