    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has a very high occurrence count of 3558, which indicates that it is duplicated across many instances. This level of duplication leads to boilerplate code and if the method signatures change, it would require a large number of modifications. Refactoring this data clump would significantly reduce potential errors during maintenance and simplify the codebase."
