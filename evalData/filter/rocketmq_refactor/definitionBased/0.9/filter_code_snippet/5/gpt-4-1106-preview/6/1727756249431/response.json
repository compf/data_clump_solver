    "key": "59",

    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 appears in the codebase with an extremely high number of occurrences (3558), suggesting significant code duplication. Reducing this data clump would likely lead to a major decrease in redundancy and improve maintainability. The combination of 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' parameters suggests there could be a high level domain concept, such as a subscription or message location, which could be extracted into a class. Doing so would also likely improve code clarity, as it would better represent the real-world entity present in the domain."
