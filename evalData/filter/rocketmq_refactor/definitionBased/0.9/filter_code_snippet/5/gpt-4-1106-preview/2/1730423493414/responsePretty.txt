    "justification": "The data clump concerning configuration properties like 'brokerConfigPath', 'regionId', 'traceOn', and various metric related configurations such as `metricsExporterType`, `metricsGrpcExporterTarget`, etc., are repeated across multiple configuration classes (`BrokerConfig` and `ProxyConfig`). This represents a high level of duplication across different files, indicating that multiple components are configured with similar properties. Extracting these common properties could improve modularity and make the codebase easier to maintain.",
