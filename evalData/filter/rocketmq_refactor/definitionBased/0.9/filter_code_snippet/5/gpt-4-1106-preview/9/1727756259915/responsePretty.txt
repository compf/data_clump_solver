The data clump with key 59 has one of the highest occurrences (3558 times) across the largest number of affected files (32), indicating a widespread pattern of duplication. This clump involves method parameters that are commonly used together (group, topic, queueId), and given the high frequency and broad impact across multiple files, refactoring could lead to significantly improved maintainability and potential performance improvements.
