  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump represented by key 59 is chosen for refactoring due to its high occurrence across the codebase, appearing 3558 times in 32 different files. This frequent repetition indicates significant code duplication, increasing the risk of inconsistencies and errors during maintenance or extension of the code. Refactoring this data clump, which involves parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId', will greatly improve the maintainability of the code by centralizing the common logic and promoting reuse."
