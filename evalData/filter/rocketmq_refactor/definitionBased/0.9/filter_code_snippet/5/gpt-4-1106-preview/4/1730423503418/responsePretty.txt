    "justification":"The data clump with the key '43' consists of several configuration fields that are common across multiple classes (BrokerConfig.java, ProxyConfig.java). These fields appear to concern the configuration settings of the system. Given that these settings are shared across various files and possibly components, it would be beneficial to encapsulate them into a single Config class to improve maintainability and avoid the duplication of code and effort when making changes to configuration settings.",
