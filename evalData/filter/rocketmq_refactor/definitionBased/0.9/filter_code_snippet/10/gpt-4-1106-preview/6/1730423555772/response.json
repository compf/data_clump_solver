    "justification": "The data clump identified by this key is spread across multiple files, affecting the consistency and maintainability of the configuration management codebase. If the common configuration parameters such as namesrvAddr, brokerConfigPath, and grpcThreadPoolNums are changed, the updates must be performed in multiple places, increasing the risk of errors and inconsistencies. By refactoring this data clump, the system's configuration management can be centralized, making it more manageable and less error-prone.",
