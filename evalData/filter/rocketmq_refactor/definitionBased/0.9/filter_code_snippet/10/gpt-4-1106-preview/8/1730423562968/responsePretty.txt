    "justification": "The BrokerConfig class and the ProxyConfig class both define a significant number of common fields and configuration parameters related to the broker's behavior and setup. These shared fields, such as namesrvAddr, brokerIP1, brokerIP2, clusterTopicEnable, traceTopicEnable, and various timeout and thread pool configurations, are used to configure different aspects of both the Broker and Proxy services. The duplication of these fields across multiple configuration classes indicates that there is a core set of configurations that are central to the functionality of the RocketMQ system. Refactoring these common fields into a separate class or a shared parent configuration class could reduce duplication, make the configuration more manageable and understandable, and make it easier to maintain consistency across the different parts of the system.",
