    "justification": "The configuration-related fields such as 'brokerConfigPath', 'namesrvAddr', 'listenPort', 'brokerIP1', 'brokerIP2', and several others are repeated and shared across multiple classes such as BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig, etc., indicating that there are multiple different configuration objects being used in different parts of the system. Refactoring this data clump is important because it affects several files and different functionalities, which suggests that changes to configuration handling, validation or extension might be difficult and error-prone and having a unified approach would make the codebase more maintainable and consistent.",
