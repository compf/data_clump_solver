  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has the parameters 'String group, String topic, int queueId' shared across methods, and it occurs 60 times across 32 files. This high level of duplication not only makes the system prone to errors when making changes but also suggests that the three parameters likely represent a coherent concept that should be encapsulated in a class. Refactoring this data clump will significantly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase.",
