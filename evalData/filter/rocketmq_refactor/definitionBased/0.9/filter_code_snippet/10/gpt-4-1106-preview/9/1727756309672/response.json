{
    "key": 59,
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The selected data clump with key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence. It is found in 32 affected files with 3558 occurrences, which indicates a significant amount of code duplication and widespread impact across the codebase. This repeated pattern of group, topic, and queueId as method parameters signifies a common operation or concept that could be abstracted into a separate class or method. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a more maintainable and readable codebase by encapsulating the common concept and reducing the repetition of the same parameter lists throughout the code."
