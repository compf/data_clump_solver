    "justification":"The data clump with key 59, located in ConsumerLagCalculator.java, is chosen based on its high frequency of occurrence (3558 times) across a large number of affected files (32 files). This indicates a widespread pattern of duplicated code throughout the codebase that involves the parameters 'String group, String topic, int queueId'. Refactoring this data clump could significantly reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and potentially simplify updates and modifications to the affected methods. Addressing such a prevalent issue would have a marked positive impact on the overall code quality."
