    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 59 in ConsumerLagCalculator.java has a very high number of occurrences (3558 times) across a significant number of affected files (32), which indicates substantial code duplication and a high impact on code maintainability. By refactoring this data clump, we can significantly reduce duplication, improve code clarity, and make it easier to maintain and update these sections of the codebase. The common parameters 'group', 'topic', 'queueId', and 'isPop' in method signatures represent a domain concept that could likely be encapsulated within a single class or context, leading to cleaner and more modular code."
