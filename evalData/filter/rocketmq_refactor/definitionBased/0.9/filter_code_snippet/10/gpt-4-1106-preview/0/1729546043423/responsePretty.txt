    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is associated with methods that calculate consumer lag statistics and message counts. This clump occurs 60 times and affects 32 files. The significant number of occurrences and the impact on a large number of files suggest that this is a widely used and repeated pattern in the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would greatly reduce duplication and potentially simplify the maintenance and evolution of related features.",
