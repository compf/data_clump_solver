  "justification": "I have chosen this data clump because it has a very high frequency of occurrence (3558 times) across many files (32 files). This indicates that the specific parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are repeatedly used together throughout the codebase. Reducing this duplication by encapsulating these parameters into a single class or structure would likely have a significant positive impact on maintainability and code clarity. The opportunity to reduce code duplication on such a large scale makes this refactoring a priority."
