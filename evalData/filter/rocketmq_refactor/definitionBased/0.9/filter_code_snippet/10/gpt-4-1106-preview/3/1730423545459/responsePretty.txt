    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 involves configuration properties that appear in various classes such as BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig, and also in subclasses of ConfigFile. This indicates a high level of duplication as multiple classes share these common fields, leading to several points of potential configuration-related errors or inconsistencies. Refactoring this clump into a shared configuration object could simplify maintenance and enforce consistency across the application. Moreover, since configuration is a common domain across different components, it would benefit from a centralized approach.",
