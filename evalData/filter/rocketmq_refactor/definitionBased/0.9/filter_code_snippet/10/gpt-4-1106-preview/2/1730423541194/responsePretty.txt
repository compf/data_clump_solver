    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 affects multiple classes and files throughout the project. This widespread impact implies that the project's maintainability and consistency could be significantly improved by refactoring this data clump. Consolidating these shared fields would not only reduce duplication but also facilitate future changes, as modifications would only need to be made in one place. The presence of the data clump in various configuration-related classes indicates that a common configuration or settings class could be beneficial.",
