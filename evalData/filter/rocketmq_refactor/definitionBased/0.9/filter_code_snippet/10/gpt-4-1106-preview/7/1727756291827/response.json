    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is the most critical to address due to its very high occurrence, with 3558 occurrences across 32 affected files. This indicates a significant amount of code duplication, suggesting that refactoring this data clump could greatly reduce complexity and improve maintainability. It involves the combination of parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId', which are likely closely related and frequently used together in operations related to message processing. By addressing this data clump, we could encapsulate these frequently recurring parameters into a single object, thus streamlining the API and reducing the risk of bugs due to parameter changes or misordering."
