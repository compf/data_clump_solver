    "justification": "The selected data clump identified by key 43 represents multiple occurrences of similar configurations parameters spread across multiple classes like BrokerConfig.java, ProxyConfig.java, etc. Refactoring these into a single configuration object or class could significantly reduce duplication and make the codebase easier to maintain, as changes to configuration parameters would only need to be made in one place.",
