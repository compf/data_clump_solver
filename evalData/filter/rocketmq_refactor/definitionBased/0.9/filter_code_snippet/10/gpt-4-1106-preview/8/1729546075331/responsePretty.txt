    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 stands out due to its high number of occurrences across various files, which suggests a significant amount of code duplication. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce the duplication and improve the maintainability and readability of the codebase. The common parameters 'group', 'topic', 'queueId' appear to represent a core concept or entity in the domain, which justifies creating a cohesive class to encapsulate these parameters, leading to cleaner and more organized code.",
