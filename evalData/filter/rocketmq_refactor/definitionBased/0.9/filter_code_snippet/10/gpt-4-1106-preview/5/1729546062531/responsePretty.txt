    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "From the provided data, the data clump with key 59 seems to be the most impactful for refactoring due to its high occurrence rate across files. It is used 60 times, which indicates a significant amount of duplication and potential for simplification across multiple files. This high occurrence rate suggests that there might be a core concept or structure present in the codebase that can be abstracted into a single class. By doing so, we would be able to reduce duplication, improve readability, and make future changes easier by centralizing the management of this concept.",
