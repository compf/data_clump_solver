    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with the key '59' has been chosen due to its exceptionally high occurrence in the codebase, with 3558 occurrences across 32 affected files. This suggests that the clump represents a ubiquitous and repetitive pattern that causes significant duplication throughout the system. Refactoring this data clump will lead to a codebase that is both easier to maintain and less prone to errors during future modification, as changes to the clump's logic would only need to be made in a single location rather than throughout numerous occurrences."
