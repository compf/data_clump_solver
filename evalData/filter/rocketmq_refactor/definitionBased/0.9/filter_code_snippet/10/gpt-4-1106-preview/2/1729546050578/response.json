    "justification": "This data clump is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, leading to widespread duplication of the parameters (group, topic, queueId) throughout the codebase. By refactoring this clump, the code can be made more maintainable and the risk of errors during further development can be reduced. Centralizing the use of these parameters in a single class would improve the cohesion and potentially simplify the method signatures that have been repeatedly used across different parts of the system.",
