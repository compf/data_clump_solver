    "justification":"The data clump identified with key 59 is chosen based on its very high occurrence which indicates significant duplication. The three parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are common fields in at least two different methods within the 'ConsumerLagCalculator' class. Since these methods are heavily utilized across 32 files with an occurrence count of 3558 times, this indicates a widespread pattern that is highly repeated. Refactoring this data clump could therefore result in a large reduction of duplicate code, improving the code maintainability and potential for errors. By extracting these parameters into a new class or structure, we encapsulate related data more effectively and make the code more modular and easier to understand."
