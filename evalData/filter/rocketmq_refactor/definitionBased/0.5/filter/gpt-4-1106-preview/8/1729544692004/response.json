    "justification":"The data clump with key 0 from 'Stats' to 'BrokerStatsManager' contains a large number of common string fields (25 in total), which suggests that these fields are related and likely represent a collection of metrics or statistics names. Refactoring this clump would greatly reduce the duplication of these string constants across different classes and centralize their management, which could simplify the codebase and reduce the potential for errors if these values need to be updated or are used in calculations.",
