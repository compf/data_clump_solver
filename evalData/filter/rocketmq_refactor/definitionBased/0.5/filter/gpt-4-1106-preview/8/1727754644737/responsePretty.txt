    "justification": "The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields between two classes, 'Stats' and 'BrokerStatsManager'. The large number of common fields (24 in total) indicates a high degree of duplication and suggests that these fields are related to a common concept or domain entity. Refactoring this data clump by possibly creating a new class or struct to encapsulate these fields could greatly reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make the codebase easier to maintain."
