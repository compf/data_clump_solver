    "justification": "The data clump with key 0 contains a large number of common fields between two classes, indicating significant duplication of constants related to stats. Refactoring this clump could lead to a more maintainable and understandable codebase by centralizing these constants into a single class or enum, reducing the risk of inconsistent changes and simplifying the code where these constants are used."
