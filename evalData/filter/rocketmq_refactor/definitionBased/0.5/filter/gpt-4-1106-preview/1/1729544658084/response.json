    "justification":"The data clump with key 0 has a significantly large number of common fields between two classes, which suggests a high level of duplication and a strong candidate for a new abstraction. With 25 common fields, this data clump likely represents a coherent piece of the domain model that has been spread across multiple classes. By extracting these fields into a separate class, we can encapsulate related behavior, reduce duplication, and improve the maintainability of the code.",
