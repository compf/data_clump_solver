The data clump with key 0 involves a large number of fields (25 fields) that are shared between the Stats and BrokerStatsManager classes. This indicates a significant amount of duplication and suggests that these fields are related and potentially represent a single concept within the domain. Refactoring this data clump could greatly reduce redundancy and improve the maintainability of the code by encapsulating these fields into a separate class or struct. This would also simplify the interfaces between classes and make the codebase easier to understand and change.
