  "justification": "The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields (25 fields in total) between two classes, indicating that these fields are potentially part of a common concept or abstraction that has not been properly encapsulated. Refactoring this data clump by creating a new class or struct to represent the shared concept can greatly reduce the size of the codebase, improve maintainability, and make the relationships between these fields more explicit."
