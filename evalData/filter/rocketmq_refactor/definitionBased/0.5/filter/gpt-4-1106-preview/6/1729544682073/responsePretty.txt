    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 contains a significant number of common fields (25 fields) shared between the Stats class and the BrokerStatsManager class. Such a large number of related fields indicates that these fields are potentially part of a larger concept that is currently not well represented in the codebase. Refactoring this data clump by extracting these fields into a separate class can improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and make the codebase more understandable by clearly representing the underlying domain concept.",
