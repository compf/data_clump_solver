  "reason": "size",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 contains a large number of fields that are common between the Stats and BrokerStatsManager classes. This indicates a significant amount of duplication that could be reduced by refactoring these fields into a separate class or a shared structure. By addressing this data clump, we could potentially simplify both classes, reduce the risk of errors when these fields are modified or used, and make the codebase more maintainable."
