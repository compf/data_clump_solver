    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 0 has a significant number of common fields between the Stats and BrokerStatsManager classes. Refactoring these common fields into a single class would greatly reduce the complexity and size of both classes, making the codebase more maintainable and understandable. Additionally, since these fields are related to statistics and metrics, encapsulating them in a single StatsMetrics class would improve the domain model and potentially simplify the interaction with these metrics.",
