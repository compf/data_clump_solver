    "justification": "The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields (25 in total) shared between the 'Stats' and 'BrokerStatsManager' classes. This large number of shared fields suggests a high potential for code duplication and a strong cohesion between these fields. Refactoring these fields into a separate class or structure could greatly reduce duplication and improve the code's maintainability by encapsulating the shared fields and providing a single point of modification."
