    "justification":"The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields (25 in total) between two classes, Stats and BrokerStatsManager. This suggests that there is a large set of related data that could be encapsulated within its own class. Refactoring this data clump would greatly reduce the complexity and duplication across these classes, making the codebase easier to maintain and understand. By creating a new class, we can also improve the cohesion of the classes involved and provide a clearer domain model.",
