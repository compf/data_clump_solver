  "key": "0",
  "reason": "size",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 0 has a significantly large number of common fields between two classes (Stats and BrokerStatsManager), which indicates a high probability of duplicated code and logic related to these fields. Refactoring this clump will likely result in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase by encapsulating these fields into a single class that can be used by both Stats and BrokerStatsManager, reducing the overall complexity.",
