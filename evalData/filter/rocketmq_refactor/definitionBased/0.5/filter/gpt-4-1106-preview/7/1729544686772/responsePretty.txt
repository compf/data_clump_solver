    "justification":"The data clump with key 26 involves multiple fields that are common between two classes within the same module (client). This clump affects many core components of the message consumer implementation and has a high impact on the maintainability of the code. Refactoring this clump could lead to a more modular design, reduce duplication, and make the codebase more understandable and easier to work with. Since both classes are related to consumer implementations, it is likely that changes in one might need to be mirrored in the other, increasing the risk of bugs if the clump is not refactored.",
