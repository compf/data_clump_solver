    "justification":"The data clump with key 0 has the largest number of common fields between two classes, indicating a significant amount of duplicated data structure that could be refactored into a shared class or structure. By addressing this data clump, we could greatly reduce the duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase. This refactoring could lead to a new class that encapsulates these common fields, thereby promoting better code organization and potentially simplifying the interaction between the 'Stats' and 'BrokerStatsManager' classes."
