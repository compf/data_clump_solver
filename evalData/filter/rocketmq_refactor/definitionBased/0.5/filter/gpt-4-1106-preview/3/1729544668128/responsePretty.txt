    "justification":"The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields between two classes, indicating a high level of duplication and a large clump size. This suggests that there is a strong case for encapsulating these fields into a separate class to promote code reuse and reduce the risk of inconsistencies. Moreover, the fields represent metrics and statistics which are conceptually related, making it a coherent set of data to be abstracted into a single class.",
