  "justification": "The data clump consisting of the fields 'namesrvAddr', 'brokerIP1', 'brokerIP2', and others related to the configuration of the broker is repeated across multiple configuration classes such as BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig, and others. This clump affects multiple files which indicates that these settings are fundamental to different components of the system. Refactoring this clump into its own class would centralize configuration management and ensure consistency across different parts of the application.",
