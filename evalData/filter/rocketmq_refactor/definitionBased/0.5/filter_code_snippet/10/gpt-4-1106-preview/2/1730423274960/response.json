    "justification":"The data clump identified by the key '43' involves several configuration parameters that are repeated across multiple classes. This clump affects a significant number of files, indicating widespread duplication of these configuration settings throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a single configuration object or class would help centralize the configuration management, making the code easier to maintain and reducing the risk of inconsistencies.",
