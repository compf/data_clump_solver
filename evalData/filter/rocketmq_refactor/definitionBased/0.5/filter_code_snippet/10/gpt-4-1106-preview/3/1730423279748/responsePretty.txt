    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 43 involves several configuration properties spread across multiple classes and files, which suggests that these properties are likely to be related and are being used in various parts of the system. Refactoring this data clump would likely improve the maintainability of the codebase by centralizing configuration management, reducing the potential for errors, and making the configuration easier to understand and modify. Since multiple files are affected, addressing this data clump could have a significant positive impact on the overall structure of the project.",
