  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is seen across multiple configuration classes (BrokerConfig.java, ProxyConfig.java) and involves common configuration fields such as namesrvAddr, brokerIP1, brokerIP2, and various settings related to thread pools and metrics. This clump affects multiple files and classes, indicating that it is a cross-cutting concern that would benefit from centralization to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
