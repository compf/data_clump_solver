    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple classes (BrokerConfig.java, ProxyConfig.java) and represents a common configuration pattern related to network settings, thread pool configurations, and other broker-related properties. This clump occurs very often across different configuration classes, leading to much duplication and the potential for inconsistency. By refactoring this clump, we can encapsulate related configuration properties into a single class, improving maintainability and reducing the risk of errors when these properties are modified or extended.",
