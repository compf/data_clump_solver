    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is selected due to its high occurrence, appearing 3558 times across 32 affected files. This suggests that there is a significant amount of duplication in the codebase, which can lead to maintenance issues and makes the code harder to understand and modify. Refactoring this data clump into a single method or class could greatly reduce the complexity and improve the maintainability of the code."
