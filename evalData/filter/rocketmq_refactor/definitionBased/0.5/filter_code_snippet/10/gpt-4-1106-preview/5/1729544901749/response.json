    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a significant impact due to its high occurrence across multiple files (32 files) and a large number of occurrences (60 times). This indicates that the code has a substantial amount of duplication related to the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId', which are used in methods across the 'ConsumerLagCalculator' class. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
