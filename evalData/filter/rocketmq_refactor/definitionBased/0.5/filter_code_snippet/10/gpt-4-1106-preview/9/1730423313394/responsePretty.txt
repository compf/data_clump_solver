    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 affects multiple files and classes, indicating that a common set of configuration properties is being used throughout different parts of the system. This widespread use of the same group of properties in multiple locations increases the risk of inconsistencies and makes the code harder to maintain. By refactoring this data clump into a single configuration class, we can reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency across the system.",
