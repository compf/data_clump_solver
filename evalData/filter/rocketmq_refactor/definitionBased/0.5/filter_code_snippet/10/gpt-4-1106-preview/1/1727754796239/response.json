    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence of 3558 times across 32 affected files. This indicates a significant amount of duplication and potential for errors due to the repeated use of the same parameters 'group', 'topic', 'queueId' across multiple methods. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce the duplication and centralize the logic related to these parameters, potentially improving maintainability and reducing the risk of bugs in the system."
