    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has a very high occurrence (3558 times), which indicates that it is a pervasive pattern in the codebase. This repetition suggests that the group, topic, and queueId parameters are frequently used together and could benefit from refactoring into a single cohesive class or structure. Reducing this duplication would simplify method signatures, improve code readability, and make the codebase easier to maintain."
