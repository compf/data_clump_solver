    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 represents a common set of configuration-related properties that are duplicated across multiple files. Refactoring this clump is important because it affects many different parts of the system (BrokerConfig.java, ProxyConfig.java, and others), leading to potential inconsistencies and making maintenance more difficult. Extracting these common properties into a shared configuration class would improve the cohesion of the system and make it easier to manage configuration changes.",
