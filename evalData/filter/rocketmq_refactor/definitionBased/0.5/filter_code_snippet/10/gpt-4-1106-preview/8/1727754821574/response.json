    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen because it has the highest occurrence across multiple files, indicating that it is frequently used and leads to a significant amount of duplication. Refactoring this data clump would likely have the most substantial impact on code maintainability and reduce the risk of errors due to changes in the parameter group. The parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are common across multiple methods, suggesting that they may represent a higher-level concept or entity within the domain that could be encapsulated in a class."
