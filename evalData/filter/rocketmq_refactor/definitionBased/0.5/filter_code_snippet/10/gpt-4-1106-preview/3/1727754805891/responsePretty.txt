The data clump identified by key 59 has a very high occurrence of 3558 times across 32 affected files. This indicates that the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are used together extensively across the codebase, leading to a significant amount of duplication. Refactoring this data clump into a single object could greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
