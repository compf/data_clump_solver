    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has a high occurrence of 60, and it affects 32 different files, indicating that the same set of parameters is being used across multiple locations. This suggests that there is significant duplication and a high potential for errors due to the repeated use of these parameters. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and make the codebase more consistent.",
