    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is found in 32 affected files and occurs 60 times, which indicates a high degree of duplication across the codebase. By refactoring this data clump, we can significantly reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and make the code more readable. The repeated parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are strongly related to the domain of message queue operations, suggesting that they represent a concept within the domain that could be encapsulated in a class.",
