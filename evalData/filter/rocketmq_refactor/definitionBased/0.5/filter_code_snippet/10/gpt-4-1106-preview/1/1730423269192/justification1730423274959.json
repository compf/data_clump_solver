  "reason": "size",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple classes (BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig) and consists of a large number of common fields related to configuration settings, such as broker address, nameserver address, thread pool numbers, and various timeouts. This clump is significant due to its size, as it comprises a large set of configuration parameters that are likely to be used together and are repeated across different classes. Refactoring this data clump into a single configuration object would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing configuration management.",
