    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 60 times across 32 affected files. This indicates a significant amount of duplication that could be reduced through refactoring. By introducing a new class to encapsulate the common parameters (group, topic, queueId), the codebase would become cleaner, more maintainable, and less error-prone.",
