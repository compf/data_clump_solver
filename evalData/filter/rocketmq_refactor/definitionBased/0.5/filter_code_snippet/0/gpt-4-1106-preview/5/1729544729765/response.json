    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is the most critical to refactor due to its high occurrence. The parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' appear together in multiple methods across 32 affected files, and there are 60 occurrences of this clump. This indicates that these parameters are likely to represent a core concept in the domain and are used frequently throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would significantly reduce duplication and improve the code's maintainability.",
