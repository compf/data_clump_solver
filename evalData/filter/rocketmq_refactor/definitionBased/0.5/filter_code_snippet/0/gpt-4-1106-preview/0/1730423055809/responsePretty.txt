    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 occurs across multiple classes in different packages (BrokerConfig.java and ProxyConfig.java), indicating that these configuration parameters are widely used throughout the application. Refactoring this data clump can significantly reduce duplication, as these parameters are likely to be modified together and may need to be passed around as a single unit of related data. Creating a class to encapsulate these related configuration parameters would improve maintainability and clarity of the codebase.",
