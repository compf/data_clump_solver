  "justification": "The fields related to metrics and configuration settings such as 'metricsGrpcExporterTarget', 'metricsGrpcExporterHeader', 'metricGrpcExporterTimeOutInMills', 'metricGrpcExporterIntervalInMills', 'metricLoggingExporterIntervalInMills', 'metricsPromExporterPort', 'metricsPromExporterHost', 'metricsLabel', 'metricsInDelta', 'channelExpiredTimeout', 'PROCESSOR_NUMBER', 'namesrvAddr', 'brokerConfigPath', 'regionId', and 'traceOn' are repeated across different classes (BrokerConfig and ProxyConfig). These fields are related to the configuration of metrics exporting and broker settings. Since they occur in different classes but are related to the same domain, it indicates there is a common configuration concern that would benefit from being extracted into a single class to avoid duplication and to facilitate changes in the future.",
