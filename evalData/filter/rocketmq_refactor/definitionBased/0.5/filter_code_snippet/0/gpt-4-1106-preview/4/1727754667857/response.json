    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across multiple files. Refactoring this data clump would likely lead to a more maintainable and less error-prone codebase, as it affects 32 files with 3558 occurrences. This data clump involves method parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' which are repeatedly used across different methods, suggesting a strong relationship and potential for a new abstraction, such as a 'TopicSubscription' class."
