    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, indicating that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is used frequently. This repetition suggests that there is a common concept or abstraction that is not yet represented by a class, leading to duplicated code and potentially making the codebase harder to maintain. By refactoring this data clump into a class, we can encapsulate the related properties and reduce the duplication across the codebase.",
