  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is spread across multiple files in different modules (common, proxy, broker), indicating that it is a cross-cutting concern. This clump includes configuration properties related to metrics, region ID, nameserver address, broker config path, and others. Refactoring this clump would likely improve maintainability and consistency across these modules.",
