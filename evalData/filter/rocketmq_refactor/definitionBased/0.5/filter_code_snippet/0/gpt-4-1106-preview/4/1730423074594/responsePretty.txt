    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 includes configuration properties that are repeated across multiple classes (BrokerConfig.java and ProxyConfig.java). This clump is chosen due to its high occurrence, as it spans across different components of the system (broker and proxy). Refactoring this clump would reduce duplication and centralize configuration management, making the codebase easier to maintain and understand.",
