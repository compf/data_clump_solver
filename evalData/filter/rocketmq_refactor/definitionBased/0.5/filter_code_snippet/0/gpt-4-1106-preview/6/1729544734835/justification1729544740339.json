  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen for refactoring due to its high occurrence, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across the codebase. This clump involves the parameters 'String group', 'String topic', and 'int queueId', which are used in methods related to consumer lag statistics. Given the number of occurrences (60) and the number of affected files (32), addressing this data clump can lead to a more maintainable and cleaner codebase by reducing redundancy and improving the coherence of the method signatures that deal with consumer statistics.",
