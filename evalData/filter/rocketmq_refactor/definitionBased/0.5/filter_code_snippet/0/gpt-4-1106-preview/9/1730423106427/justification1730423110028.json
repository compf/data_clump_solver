  "key": "43",
  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 includes configuration properties that are duplicated across two different classes (`BrokerConfig.java` and `ProxyConfig.java`). This indicates that multiple files (at least two different classes in different packages) are affected by the same data clump, which can lead to inconsistencies and make the system harder to maintain. Having a single source of truth for configuration properties would improve maintainability and reduce the risk of divergent configurations between different parts of the system.",
