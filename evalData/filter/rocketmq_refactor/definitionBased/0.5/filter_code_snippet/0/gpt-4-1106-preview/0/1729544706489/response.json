    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence, with 60 occurrences and affecting 32 files. This suggests that the clump is widespread throughout the codebase, leading to a significant amount of duplication and potentially making maintenance more difficult. Refactoring this data clump could greatly reduce redundancy and improve the maintainability of the code.",
