{
    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 appears in 32 affected files with a high occurrence of 3558 times. This suggests that the code base has a significant amount of duplication related to this clump, which can lead to maintenance issues and increased risk of bugs due to the repeated logic. Refactoring this data clump by extracting common parameters into a single class or structuring them appropriately would greatly reduce code duplication and improve the maintainability of the code."
