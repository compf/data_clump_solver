  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen because it occurs 60 times, which indicates a high level of code duplication and a significant opportunity for refactoring. By extracting these parameters into a separate class, we can reduce the duplication and make the codebase more maintainable. The common parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' suggest a domain concept that is frequently used across different methods, which can be encapsulated in a class to represent the concept of a message queue context or similar.",
