The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence metric (3558 occurrences), which indicates that it is a pattern that is repeated very often across multiple files (32 affected files). This frequent repetition of the same set of parameters ('group', 'topic', 'queueId') in different methods suggests that there is significant duplication in the codebase and that these methods are likely to be related to a common domain concept. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure would reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make future changes easier to implement. The high occurrence also implies that the potential for bugs is increased every time this set of parameters is used, so centralizing it would reduce this risk as well.
