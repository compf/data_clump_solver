    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which suggests that it is a recurring pattern in the codebase leading to significant duplication. Refactoring this data clump would potentially reduce the duplication of the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' across multiple methods in different classes, thereby improving the maintainability of the code.",
