    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, which leads to significant duplication. Refactoring this data clump will not only reduce duplication but also simplify future changes related to consumer lag calculation, as changes will only need to be made in one place instead of in every instance where the clump occurs. This will improve maintainability and reduce the likelihood of errors during future modifications.",
