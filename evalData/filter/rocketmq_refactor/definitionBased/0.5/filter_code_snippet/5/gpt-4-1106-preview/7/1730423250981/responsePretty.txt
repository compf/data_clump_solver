    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is found in multiple configuration classes across different modules, indicating that the same configuration parameters are being replicated in various places. This can be problematic as it increases the risk of inconsistencies and makes the maintenance of the configuration parameters more difficult. By refactoring this data clump, we can centralize the configuration management, improve code reusability, and ensure that changes to these parameters are reflected consistently across all modules.",
