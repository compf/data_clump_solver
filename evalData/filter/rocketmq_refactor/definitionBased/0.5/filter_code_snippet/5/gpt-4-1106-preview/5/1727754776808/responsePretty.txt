The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen for refactoring due to its high occurrence. This clump involves the parameters (String group, String topic, int queueId) and appears 3558 times across 32 affected files, indicating a significant amount of duplication and a strong candidate for creating a new abstraction to encapsulate these parameters. Refactoring this clump would greatly reduce the duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase.
