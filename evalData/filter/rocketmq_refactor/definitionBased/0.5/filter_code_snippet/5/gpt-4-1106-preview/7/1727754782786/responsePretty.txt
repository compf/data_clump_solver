justification:"
The data clump identified by key 59 has a very high occurrence (3558 times) across many affected files (32 files), indicating that the common parameters group, topic, and queueId are used extensively throughout the codebase. This suggests that there is a significant amount of duplication involving these parameters, and refactoring them into a single class or structure could greatly reduce redundancy and improve code maintainability. The high frequency of this data clump's occurrence makes it a prime candidate for refactoring.
