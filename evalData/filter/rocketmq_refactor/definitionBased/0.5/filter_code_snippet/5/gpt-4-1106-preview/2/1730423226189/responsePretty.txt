    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 26 consists of several parameters related to timing and delays (pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException, PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL, PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL, PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_PAUSE) that are used across different classes (DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl and DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl). This data clump occurs multiple times and is related to the consumer's behavior in various scenarios, indicating that these parameters are closely related and are duplicated across classes. Refactoring this clump into a single class would centralize the configuration of these timings, reduce duplication, and make the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.",
