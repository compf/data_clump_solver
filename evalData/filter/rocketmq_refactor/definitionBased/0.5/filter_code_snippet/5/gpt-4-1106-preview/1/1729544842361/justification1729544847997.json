  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates significant code duplication. This data clump is used in 32 affected files with 60 occurrences, suggesting that it is a common pattern throughout the codebase. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and make future changes to this group of parameters easier to manage. Since the parameters group, topic, and queueId are related to consumer lag statistics, it makes sense to encapsulate them into a single class that represents a consumer queue identifier or context.",
