    "key": "43",
    "reason": "affected_files",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by the key '43' includes configurations with common fields such as `namesrvAddr`, `brokerConfigPath`, `metricsExporterType`, `metricsLabel`, and others. These fields are spread across multiple configuration classes (`BrokerConfig` and `ProxyConfig`), which indicates that multiple files (and thus, components of the system) are affected by this data clump. Refactoring these common fields into a single configuration class or structure would simplify the codebase, reduce duplication, and make it easier to manage and understand the configuration-related code.",
