    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 consists of configuration-related fields and parameters that are common across multiple classes. This data clump occurs very often, indicating that these configuration settings are used throughout the system. Refactoring this data clump into a single configuration object would reduce duplication and centralize configuration management, making the codebase easier to maintain and understand.",
