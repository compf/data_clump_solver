  "justification": "The fields related to timing delays and flow control counters occur in multiple classes (DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl, DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl), indicating that these concepts are reused across different parts of the system. Refactoring these fields into a separate class could reduce duplication and improve code maintainability.",
