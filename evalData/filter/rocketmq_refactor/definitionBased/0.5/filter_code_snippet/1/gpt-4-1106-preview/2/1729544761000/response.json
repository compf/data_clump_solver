    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, which indicates significant duplication and potential for simplification. Refactoring this data clump could lead to a more maintainable and less error-prone codebase, as changes to the group, topic, and queueId parameters would only need to be made in one place rather than across many methods that currently duplicate this data clump.",
