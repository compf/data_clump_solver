  "key": "26",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is selected because of its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields `pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException`, `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL`, `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL`, `queueFlowControlTimes`, and `queueMaxSpanFlowControlTimes` are repeated in both `DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl` and `DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl`. Since these fields are related to consumer behavior and flow control, they are repeatedly used and lead to significant duplication of code and logic. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
