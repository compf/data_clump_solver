    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. This clump includes the parameters `pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException`, `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL`, `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL`, `queueFlowControlTimes`, `queueMaxSpanFlowControlTimes`, and other related configuration settings that are related to pulling messages and flow control. This repeated group of parameters indicates a common concept of pull-related configuration that is used in different contexts within the consumer implementations. By refactoring this data clump into a separate class, we can encapsulate the pull configuration settings in one place, improve the code's maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of errors when these settings need to be changed or extended.",
