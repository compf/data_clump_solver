    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which implies that the same set of parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are being passed around in multiple places, leading to significant code duplication. Refactoring this data clump would potentially reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the handling of these parameters.",
