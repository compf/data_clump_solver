    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the group, topic, and queueId parameters are repeated across many methods and likely throughout different parts of the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve maintainability, as changes to the concept represented by these parameters would only need to be made in a single place.",
