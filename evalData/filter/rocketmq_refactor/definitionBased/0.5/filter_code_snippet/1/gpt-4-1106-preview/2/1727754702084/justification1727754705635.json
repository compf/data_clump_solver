  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key '59' is chosen because it has the highest occurrence (3558 times), which indicates a significant amount of duplication across many files (32 different files). This implies that the common parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are used very frequently across methods, and refactoring them into a single class or structure could greatly reduce the complexity and improve maintainability of the codebase."
