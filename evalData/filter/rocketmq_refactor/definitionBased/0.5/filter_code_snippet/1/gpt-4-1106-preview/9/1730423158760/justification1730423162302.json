  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 occurs multiple times across different files and classes within the same project. It involves parameters related to pull time delays, flow control, and hooks lists, which are likely to be used in similar contexts when dealing with message consumption and flow control logic. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the related configuration and behavior.",
