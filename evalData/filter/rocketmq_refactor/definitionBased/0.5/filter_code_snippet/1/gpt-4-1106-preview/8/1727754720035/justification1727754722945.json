  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 3558, which suggests that it is a common pattern repeated throughout the codebase. This leads to significant code duplication and potential for errors if changes are made. Refactoring this data clump can greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability."
