    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has the highest occurrence count of 3558, which indicates that the group, topic, and queueId parameters are used together very frequently across 32 files. This suggests that a significant amount of duplication exists in the codebase, and refactoring this data clump could lead to a considerable reduction in code duplication, improved maintainability, and potentially easier future changes or extensions to this part of the system."
