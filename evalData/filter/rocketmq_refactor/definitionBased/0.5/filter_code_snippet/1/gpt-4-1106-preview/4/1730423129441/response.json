    "justification": "The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL' are repeated across two different classes (DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl and DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl), indicating that they share a common purpose and are likely to be modified together. This repetition suggests that these fields are candidates for encapsulation into a separate class to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
