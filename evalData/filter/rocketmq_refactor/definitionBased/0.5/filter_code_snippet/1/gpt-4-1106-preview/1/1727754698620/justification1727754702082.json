  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has the highest occurrence, being used 3558 times across 32 affected files. This indicates a widespread duplication of the parameters 'String group', 'String topic', and 'int queueId' throughout the codebase, which can lead to maintenance issues and make the code harder to understand. Refactoring this data clump can significantly reduce duplication and improve code quality."
