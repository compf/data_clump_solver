  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 appears in 32 affected files and has a high occurrence count of 60. This suggests that the same set of parameters ('group', 'topic', 'queueId') is being used across multiple methods, which could lead to duplication and increased maintenance effort if changes are needed in the parameter list. By refactoring this data clump into a single class, we can reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
