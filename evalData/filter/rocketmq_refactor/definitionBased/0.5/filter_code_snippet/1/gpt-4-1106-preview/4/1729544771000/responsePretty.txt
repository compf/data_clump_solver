    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen for refactoring due to its high occurrence. It appears 60 times across 32 affected files, indicating a significant amount of duplication and a widespread impact on the codebase. Refactoring this data clump will likely improve maintainability and reduce the risk of bugs when the common parameters (group, topic, queueId) are changed or extended. By extracting these parameters into a separate class, we can encapsulate the related behavior and simplify method signatures across the affected files.",
