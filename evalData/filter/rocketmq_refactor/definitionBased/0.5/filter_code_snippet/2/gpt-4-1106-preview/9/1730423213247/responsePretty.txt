    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its frequent occurrence across multiple classes, indicating significant duplication of the flow control timing configurations and other consumer-related settings. This repeated pattern suggests that these configurations are conceptually related and could benefit from being encapsulated in a single class to promote reusability and reduce the risk of inconsistencies.",
