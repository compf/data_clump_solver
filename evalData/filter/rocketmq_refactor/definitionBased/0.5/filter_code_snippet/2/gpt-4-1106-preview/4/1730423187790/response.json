    "justification":"The data clump consisting of `pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException`, `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL`, and `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL` is chosen because it affects multiple files. These parameters are related to pull time delay configurations and are used across different consumer implementation classes, suggesting that they are a common concept that should be encapsulated in its own class to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
