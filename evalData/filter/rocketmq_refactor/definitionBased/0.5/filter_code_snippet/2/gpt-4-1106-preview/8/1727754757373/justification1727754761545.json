  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen for refactoring due to its very high occurrence, which leads to significant code duplication. This data clump appears 3558 times across 32 affected files, indicating that it is a widespread issue within the codebase. By refactoring this data clump, we can greatly reduce the duplication and improve the maintainability of the code. The common parameters 'String group, String topic, int queueId' suggest that these could be encapsulated into a single object, potentially named 'ConsumerTopicQueue', which would simplify method signatures and calls, and centralize related operations."
