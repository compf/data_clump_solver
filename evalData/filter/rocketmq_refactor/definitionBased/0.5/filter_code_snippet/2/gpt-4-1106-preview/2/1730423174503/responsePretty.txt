    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen because it occurs very often across multiple classes. The repeated fields such as 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL' are found in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl'. This repetition suggests a common concept related to pull time delay configurations that is spread across multiple consumer implementations, leading to code duplication and a higher chance for inconsistencies.",
