  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 67 involves the parameters 'String topic, int queueId, long offset' which are repeated across multiple methods in the ConsumerLagCalculator and EscapeBridge classes. This clump is chosen due to its high occurrence, which suggests that these parameters are a group of data that should be managed together. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate the related data into a single object, improving code maintainability and reducing the risk of errors when these parameters need to be passed around the system.",
