    "key": 59,
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with the key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates that the same group of parameters is used across multiple methods and occurs 60 times. This repetition suggests that there is a significant amount of code duplication, which can lead to maintenance issues and make the codebase harder to understand and modify. By refactoring this data clump, we can improve the code's modularity and reduce the risk of errors when making changes to the related functionality.",
