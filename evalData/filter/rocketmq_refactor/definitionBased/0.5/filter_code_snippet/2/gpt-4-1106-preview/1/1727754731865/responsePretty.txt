    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has a very high occurrence rate with 3558 occurrences across 32 affected files. This implies a significant amount of duplication throughout the codebase, which can lead to maintenance issues and make the code more error-prone. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a substantial improvement in code quality and reduce the potential for bugs when these parameters are modified or accessed."
