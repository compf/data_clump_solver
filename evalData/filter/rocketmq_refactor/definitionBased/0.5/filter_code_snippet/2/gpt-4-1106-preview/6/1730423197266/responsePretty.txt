    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 occurs multiple times across different classes in the client module. It consists of fields and constants related to timing and flow control for message pulling which are used in both DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl and DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl classes. This repetition suggests that these timing and flow control properties are a cross-cutting concern for message consumers and thus should be abstracted into a separate class to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
