    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has the highest occurrence, with 60 instances across 32 affected files. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication that could significantly benefit from refactoring. By addressing this data clump, we can reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and potentially prevent future bugs related to changes in these common parameters. Moreover, since it involves method parameters, it suggests that a common operation is being repeated, which could be encapsulated in a single method or class.",
