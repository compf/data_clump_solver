  "key": "26",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across several classes, indicating significant duplication. This clump includes parameters and fields related to delay and flow control in message consumption, which are used in both `DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl` and `DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl`. The repeated use of these similar parameters across consumer implementations suggests that they are part of a common concept in the domain of message consumption control, which would benefit from being refactored into a single class.",
