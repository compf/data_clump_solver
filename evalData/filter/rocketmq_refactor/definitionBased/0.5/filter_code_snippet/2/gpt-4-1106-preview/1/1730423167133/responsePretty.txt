    "key": "26",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen because the same set of parameters related to pull time delays and flow control appears multiple times in different classes (DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl, DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl). These parameters are used to handle message pulling and flow control logic which is a core part of the message consumption process. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and centralize the configuration for pull behavior, making it easier to maintain and modify this behavior across different consumer implementations.",
