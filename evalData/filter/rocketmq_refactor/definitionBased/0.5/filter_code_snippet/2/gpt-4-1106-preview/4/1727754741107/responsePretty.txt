justification:"
The data clump with key 59 has a very high occurrence count of 3558, which indicates that the group, topic, and queueId parameters are being used together very frequently across many parts of the codebase. This suggests that there is a significant amount of duplication that could be reduced by refactoring these parameters into a single object, potentially improving maintainability and reducing the likelihood of errors when these parameters need to be modified or used in new contexts.
