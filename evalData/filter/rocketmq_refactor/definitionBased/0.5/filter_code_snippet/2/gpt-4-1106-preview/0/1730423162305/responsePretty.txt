    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 involves fields related to pull time delays and flow control which are repeated across multiple consumer implementation classes (DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl and DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl). This repetition suggests a common concern that is likely to change together and could be encapsulated in a single class. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the control of pull-related behavior.",
