    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "This data clump is chosen based on its high occurrence, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across the codebase. The parameters 'String group, String topic, int queueId' are repeated 3558 times across 32 files, suggesting that these parameters are a core part of the domain model and are frequently used together. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure could greatly reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make the codebase easier to maintain."
