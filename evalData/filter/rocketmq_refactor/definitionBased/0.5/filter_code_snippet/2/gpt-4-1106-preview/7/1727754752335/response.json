    "justification":"The data clump with key '59' is chosen because it has the highest occurrence with 3558 duplications across 32 affected files, indicating that the common parameters 'group', 'topic', 'queueId' (and sometimes 'isPop') are widely used and duplicated across many methods and classes in the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure would significantly reduce duplication and improve maintainability. The high occurrence suggests that it is a critical part of the domain logic related to consumer lag calculation in the message queue system, and refactoring it could lead to better abstraction and encapsulation of the related concepts."
