justification:"
This data clump occurs in multiple files, indicating that the broker configuration is a common concept across these components. By refactoring this clump, we could potentially improve the maintainability and readability of the code by encapsulating the broker configuration into its own class or structure. This would make it easier to manage the broker configuration as a single entity and could reduce the risk of errors when dealing with broker configuration in different parts of the system.
