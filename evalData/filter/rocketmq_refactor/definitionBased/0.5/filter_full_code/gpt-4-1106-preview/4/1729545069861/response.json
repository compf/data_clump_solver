    "justification":"The `BrokerConfig` class contains several fields that are related to the configuration of a broker in the RocketMQ system. These fields include settings for the broker's name, cluster name, IP address, port, permissions, topic settings, and various other configurations that are essential for the broker's operation. Extracting these fields into a separate class would encapsulate the broker configuration settings and promote better code organization, maintainability, and readability. It also allows for easier modification and extension of broker configuration options in the future.",
