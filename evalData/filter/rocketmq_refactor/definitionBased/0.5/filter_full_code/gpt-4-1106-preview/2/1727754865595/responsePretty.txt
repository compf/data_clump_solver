reason:"
domain
",
justification:"
The data clump located in the DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl class consists of a ConcurrentHashMap that stores topic and sub-expression pairs (String topic, String subExpression). This is a clear example of a domain concept that could be extracted into its own class, such as a 'Subscription' class that encapsulates both the topic and the sub-expression. This would improve the code's readability and maintainability by representing the subscription concept more explicitly.
