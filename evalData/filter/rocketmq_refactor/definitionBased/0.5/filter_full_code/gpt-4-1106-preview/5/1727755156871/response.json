    "justification":"<The data clump identified is a set of constants representing different types of statistics. Each constant is a String that is used as a key for identifying a specific metric related to queue and topic operations such as PUT and GET actions. These constants are related by the domain concept of messaging statistics, where each one represents a metric for tracking the behavior of queues and topics within the broker. By extracting these constants into a separate class or enumeration that represents the domain of broker statistics, the code can be made cleaner, and the association between these related constants becomes more explicit, improving maintainability and readability.>"
