    "justification":"The selected code snippet from 'BrokerConfig.java' defines a configuration property 'enableRetryTopicV2' along with its getter and setter methods. This property determines whether the retry topic version 2 is enabled or not. It's a specific domain-related configuration that could potentially be extracted into a separate class, such as 'RetryPolicyConfig', to encapsulate the retry behavior settings. This would improve modularity and make the configuration management more domain-oriented."
