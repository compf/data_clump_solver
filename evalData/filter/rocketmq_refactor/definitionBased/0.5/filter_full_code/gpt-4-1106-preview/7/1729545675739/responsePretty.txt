    "justification": "The 'ConsumerLagCalculator' class in 'ConsumerLagCalculator.java' is responsible for calculating the lag of consumers, which is a domain-specific operation. It involves various components such as 'BrokerConfig', 'TopicConfigManager', 'ConsumerManager', 'ConsumerOffsetManager', 'ConsumerFilterManager', 'SubscriptionGroupManager', 'MessageStore', 'PopBufferMergeService', and 'PopInflightMessageCounter', all of which are part of the domain of message queuing and consumer management. Extracting this class into a separate domain model would encapsulate the logic for consumer lag calculation and make it reusable and maintainable.",
