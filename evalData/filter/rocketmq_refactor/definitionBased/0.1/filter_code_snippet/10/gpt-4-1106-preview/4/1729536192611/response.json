    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates significant duplication across multiple files. This clump involves the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId', which are used in methods related to consumer lag statistics. Given that these parameters are used together in 60 occurrences across 32 files, refactoring this clump would greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
