    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple classes across different modules (BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig, etc.), indicating that the same set of configuration parameters is being duplicated across various parts of the system. This repetition suggests that these parameters are a core part of the system's configuration domain and are likely to be used frequently throughout the application. Refactoring this data clump into a single configuration class would reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and make it easier to manage and validate configuration parameters consistently.",
