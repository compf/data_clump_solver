  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple files, indicating that the same set of configuration parameters is being used across different components of the system. This widespread duplication can lead to inconsistencies and makes the codebase harder to maintain. By refactoring these parameters into a single configuration class, we can reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency across the system.",
