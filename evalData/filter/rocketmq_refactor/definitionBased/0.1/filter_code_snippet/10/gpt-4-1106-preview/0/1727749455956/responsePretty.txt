    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a very high occurrence count of 3558, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across 32 affected files. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a substantial reduction in code duplication, improving maintainability and potentially reducing the likelihood of bugs related to the repeated use of these parameters."
