  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, which indicates significant duplication of the parameter list. This clump involves the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId', which are used in methods related to consumer lag statistics in the ConsumerLagCalculator class. The high frequency of occurrence suggests that these parameters are a core part of the domain logic and are likely to be used together in various parts of the system. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code.",
