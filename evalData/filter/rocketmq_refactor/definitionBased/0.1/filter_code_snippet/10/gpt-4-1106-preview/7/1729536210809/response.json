    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods and likely in multiple classes. This repetition suggests that there is a common concept or operation being performed that could benefit from being encapsulated into its own class. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make future changes easier as they would only need to be applied in one place.",
