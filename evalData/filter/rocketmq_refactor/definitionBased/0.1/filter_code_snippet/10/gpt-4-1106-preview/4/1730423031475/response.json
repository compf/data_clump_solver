    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple configuration classes across different modules (BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig, etc.). This clump includes fields such as 'namesrvAddr', 'brokerConfigPath', and 'metricsExporterType', which are configuration parameters that are likely to be used across various components of the system. Refactoring this clump would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing common configuration handling.",
