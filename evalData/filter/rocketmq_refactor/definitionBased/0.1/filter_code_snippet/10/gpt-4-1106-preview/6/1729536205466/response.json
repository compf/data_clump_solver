    "key": "59",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods and likely in multiple classes. This repetition suggests that there is a strong relationship between these parameters, and they are frequently used together in the context of consumer lag calculation. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would significantly reduce duplication and improve the code's maintainability.",
