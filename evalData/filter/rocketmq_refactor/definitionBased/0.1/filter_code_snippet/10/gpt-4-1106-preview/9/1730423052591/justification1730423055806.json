  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple files across different modules (BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig, etc.), indicating that the configuration properties are duplicated across various components of the system. Refactoring this data clump would likely reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing configuration management.",
