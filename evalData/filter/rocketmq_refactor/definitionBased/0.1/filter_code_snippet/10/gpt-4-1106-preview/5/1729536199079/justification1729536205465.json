  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods and likely in different classes. This repetition suggests that there is a common concept or operation being represented by these parameters that could be encapsulated into a single class. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code by centralizing the common logic. It would also make the code more readable and easier to understand, as the purpose of these parameters would be represented by a single, cohesive abstraction.",
