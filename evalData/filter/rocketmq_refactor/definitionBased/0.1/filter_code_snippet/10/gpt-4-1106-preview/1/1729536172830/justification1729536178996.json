  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates significant code duplication across 32 affected files. This repetition of the group, topic, and queueId parameters in multiple methods suggests that these parameters are closely related and are used together frequently. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would greatly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase.",
