    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple configuration classes across different modules (BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig, etc.), which indicates that these classes share common configuration fields. Refactoring this data clump would likely improve the maintainability and reusability of the configuration code, as changes to the common fields would only need to be made in one place rather than in each individual class. This can also help prevent inconsistencies and bugs related to configuration management.",
