    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen because it has the highest occurrence across multiple files, which indicates that it leads to significant duplication of code. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a more maintainable and less error-prone codebase. The parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are used frequently together in methods related to consumer lag statistics, suggesting that they represent a common concept in the domain of message queuing.",
