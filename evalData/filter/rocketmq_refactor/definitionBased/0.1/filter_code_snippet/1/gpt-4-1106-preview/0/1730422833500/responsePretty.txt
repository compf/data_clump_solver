    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen because it occurs very often across multiple classes, leading to significant duplication. The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL', 'queueFlowControlTimes', and 'queueMaxSpanFlowControlTimes' are common in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl' classes. This repetition suggests that these fields are related and could be part of a common concept that is not yet represented in the codebase. By refactoring these fields into a separate class, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make the codebase easier to maintain.",
