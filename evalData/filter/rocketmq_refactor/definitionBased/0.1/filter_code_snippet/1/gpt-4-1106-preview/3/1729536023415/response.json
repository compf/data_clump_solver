    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the group, topic, and queueId parameters are commonly used together across multiple methods and likely in various parts of the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would significantly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code. By encapsulating these parameters into a single concept, we can pass around a single object instead of multiple parameters, making the method signatures cleaner and the code easier to understand.",
