  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence of 3558, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across 32 affected files. This suggests that the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are commonly used together in various methods, leading to repetitive code and a potential maintenance burden. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure could greatly reduce duplication and improve code readability and maintainability."
