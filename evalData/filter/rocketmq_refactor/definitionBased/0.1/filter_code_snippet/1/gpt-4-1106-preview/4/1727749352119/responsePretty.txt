    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has a very high occurrence count (3558), which indicates that the group, topic, and queueId parameters are used together across many methods and potentially many classes. This suggests that there is a significant amount of duplication and tight coupling in the codebase related to these parameters. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure could greatly reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make the codebase easier to maintain."
