  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL' are repeated in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl' classes. This repetition indicates a common concept that is not yet encapsulated in a single class, leading to code duplication and potential inconsistencies if changes are required in the future.",
