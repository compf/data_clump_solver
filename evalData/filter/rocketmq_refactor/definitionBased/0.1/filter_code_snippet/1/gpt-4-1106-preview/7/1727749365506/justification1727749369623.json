  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence of 3558, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across 32 affected files. This suggests that the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are commonly used together throughout the codebase, and refactoring this clump into a single object could greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability."
