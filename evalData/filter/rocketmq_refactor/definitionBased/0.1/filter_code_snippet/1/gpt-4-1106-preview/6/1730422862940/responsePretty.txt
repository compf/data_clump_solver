    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL' are repeated in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl' classes. This repetition indicates that these fields are related and are used in a similar context within the consumer implementation, leading to duplicated code and potential inconsistencies if changes are required. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
