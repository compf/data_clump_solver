    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 3558 times across 32 affected files. This indicates a significant amount of duplication and a strong case for refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce the potential for errors. By addressing this data clump, we can simplify the codebase and potentially improve performance by reducing the overhead associated with passing around multiple parameters."
