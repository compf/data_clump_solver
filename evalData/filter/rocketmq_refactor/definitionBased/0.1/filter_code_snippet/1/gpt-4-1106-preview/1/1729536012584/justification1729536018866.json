  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, indicating that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods in the ConsumerLagCalculator class. This repetition suggests that these parameters are closely related and are likely to change together, making them a prime candidate for refactoring into a single class. By extracting these parameters into a class, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make future changes to this group of parameters easier to manage.",
