  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL', 'queueFlowControlTimes', and 'queueMaxSpanFlowControlTimes' are common in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl' classes. This repetition suggests that these fields are related to a common concept of consumer behavior and flow control, which could be encapsulated in a separate class to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
