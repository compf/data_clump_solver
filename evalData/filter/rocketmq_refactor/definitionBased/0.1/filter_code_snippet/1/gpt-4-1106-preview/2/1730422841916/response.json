    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 includes configuration properties that are common across multiple configuration classes, affecting several files. This indicates that these properties are central to the configuration of different components within the system. By refactoring this data clump, we can centralize the configuration management, reduce duplication, and improve maintainability. It is likely that these properties are changed together and should be managed in a cohesive manner.",
