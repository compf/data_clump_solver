  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL', 'queueFlowControlTimes', and 'queueMaxSpanFlowControlTimes' are common in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl' classes. This repetition indicates that these fields are related and potentially represent a concept within the domain that could be encapsulated in a separate class. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve the code's maintainability.",
