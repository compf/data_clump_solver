    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence, appearing 60 times across 32 affected files. This indicates a significant amount of duplication and a strong case for refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce the potential for errors. By extracting these common parameters into a separate class, we can encapsulate the related concepts and simplify method signatures, which will make the codebase cleaner and easier to understand.",
