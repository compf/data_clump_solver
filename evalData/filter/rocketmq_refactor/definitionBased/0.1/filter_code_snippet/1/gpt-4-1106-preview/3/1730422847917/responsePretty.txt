    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL' are repeated in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl' classes. This repetition suggests that these fields are related and could be part of a common configuration or policy regarding pull delays. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and centralize the configuration for pull delays, making the codebase easier to maintain and understand.",
