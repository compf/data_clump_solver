    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods and likely in different classes. This repetition suggests that there is a common concept or operation being represented by these parameters, which could be encapsulated into a single class. Refactoring this data clump would significantly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code by centralizing the common logic.",
