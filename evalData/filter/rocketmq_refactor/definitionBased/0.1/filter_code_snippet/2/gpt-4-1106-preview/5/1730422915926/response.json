    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields `pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException`, `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL`, and `PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL` are repeated in both `DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl` and `DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl`. This repetition suggests that these fields are related to a common concept of pull time delay configuration, which is used in different contexts within the consumer implementations. By refactoring this data clump into a separate class, we can encapsulate the pull time delay configuration logic in one place, making the code more maintainable and reducing the risk of inconsistencies.",
