    "key": "59",

    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence of 3558 times across 32 affected files, indicating a significant amount of duplication that could be reduced through refactoring. This clump involves the parameters 'String group', 'String topic', and 'int queueId', which are likely to represent a common concept in the domain of message queuing and consumer lag calculation. By extracting these parameters into a single class or structure, the codebase could be made more maintainable and the risk of errors due to parameter changes could be reduced."
