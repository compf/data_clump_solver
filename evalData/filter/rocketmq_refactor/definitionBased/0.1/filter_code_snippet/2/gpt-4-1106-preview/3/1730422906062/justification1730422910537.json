  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL' are repeated in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl'. This repetition indicates that these fields are related and are used in a similar context, which suggests that they could be part of a common concept or configuration object. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code.",
