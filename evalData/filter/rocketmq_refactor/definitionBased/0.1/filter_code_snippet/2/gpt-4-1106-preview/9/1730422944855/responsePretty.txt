    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes, which indicates significant duplication of code. This clump includes the fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL', which are related to pull time delays and flow control in message consumption. These fields are duplicated in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl' classes, suggesting that they are part of a common concept related to consumer configuration and behavior. Refactoring this clump into a separate class would reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and make it easier to manage consumer-related configurations.",
