    "key": "26",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL' are repeated in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl' classes. This repetition indicates a common concept that is not encapsulated in a single place, leading to duplicated code and potential inconsistencies if changes are made. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
