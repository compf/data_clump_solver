    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 3558, which indicates that the parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are used together very frequently across 32 affected files. This suggests that there is significant duplication of code involving these parameters, and refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure could greatly reduce redundancy and improve maintainability."
