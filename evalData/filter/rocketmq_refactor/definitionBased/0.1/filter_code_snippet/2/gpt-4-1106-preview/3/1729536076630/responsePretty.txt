    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is used across multiple methods in the ConsumerLagCalculator class. This repetition suggests that these parameters are closely related and represent a concept in the domain that could be encapsulated in a class. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code by centralizing the logic related to consumer lag calculation.",
