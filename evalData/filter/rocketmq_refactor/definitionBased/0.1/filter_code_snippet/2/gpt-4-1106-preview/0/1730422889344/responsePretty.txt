    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes, which indicates significant duplication of the same set of fields. This clump includes fields related to delay and flow control settings in consumer implementations, which are crucial for managing message consumption rates and ensuring stability under various load conditions. Refactoring this clump into a separate class would reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and centralize configuration management for these settings.",
