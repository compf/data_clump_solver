  "key": "26",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 26 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. The fields 'pullTimeDelayMillsWhenException', 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_CACHE_FLOW_CONTROL', and 'PULL_TIME_DELAY_MILLS_WHEN_BROKER_FLOW_CONTROL' are common in both 'DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl' and 'DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl'. This repetition suggests that these fields are related to a common concept of pull time delay configuration, which is used in different contexts within the consumer implementations. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the configuration of pull time delays.",
