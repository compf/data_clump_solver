    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods and likely in different classes. This repetition suggests that there is a significant amount of duplication in the codebase, which can lead to maintenance issues and make the code harder to understand and modify. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate these parameters into a single class, which will improve code readability and make it easier to manage changes to this group of related data.",
