  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods and likely in multiple classes. This repetition suggests that there is a common concept or entity that is being represented by these parameters, and it is being used extensively throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would significantly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code by encapsulating the related parameters into a single, coherent abstraction.",
