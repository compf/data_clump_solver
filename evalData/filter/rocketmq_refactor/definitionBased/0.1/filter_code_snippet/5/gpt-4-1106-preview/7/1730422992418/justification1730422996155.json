  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple configuration classes across different modules (BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig). This indicates that the same set of configuration parameters is being duplicated across various parts of the system, which can lead to inconsistencies and makes the system harder to maintain. By refactoring this data clump, we can centralize the configuration management, reduce duplication, and improve the maintainability of the system.",
