    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple configuration classes across different modules (BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig). This indicates that the same set of configuration parameters is being reused in various parts of the system, which can lead to duplication and the potential for inconsistent changes. Refactoring this data clump into a shared configuration class would centralize the management of these settings and reduce the risk of errors.",
