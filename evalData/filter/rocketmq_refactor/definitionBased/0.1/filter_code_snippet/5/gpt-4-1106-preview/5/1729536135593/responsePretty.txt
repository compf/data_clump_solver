    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, which indicates a significant amount of duplication. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a more maintainable and less error-prone codebase, as the common parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are used frequently in methods related to consumer lag statistics. By introducing a new class to encapsulate these parameters, we can reduce the duplication and make the code more modular.",
