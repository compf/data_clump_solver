    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple classes (BrokerConfig.java, ProxyConfig.java) and involves several configuration properties that are common across these classes. This indicates a high level of duplication and suggests that these properties are conceptually related, making them a prime candidate for refactoring into a separate configuration class. By extracting these common properties into a single class, we can reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and make it easier to manage configuration changes across the system.",
