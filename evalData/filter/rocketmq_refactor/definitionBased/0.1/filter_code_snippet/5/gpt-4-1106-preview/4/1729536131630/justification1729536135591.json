  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, indicating that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods and likely multiple classes. This repetition suggests that there is a common concept or operation being represented by these parameters, which could be encapsulated into a single class to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
