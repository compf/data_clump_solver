  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence rate of 3558, which indicates that the common parameters 'group', 'topic', and 'queueId' are used very frequently across the codebase. This suggests that there is significant duplication of code involving these parameters, which could be greatly reduced by refactoring the code to encapsulate these parameters into a single object. By doing so, the code would become cleaner, easier to maintain, and less error-prone, as changes to the related logic would only need to be made in one place rather than across many different methods."
