  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple configuration-related classes across different modules (BrokerConfig, ProxyConfig). This indicates that the same configuration parameters are being reused in various parts of the system, which can lead to difficulties in maintaining and understanding the code. Refactoring this data clump would improve the modularity of the configuration management and make the system easier to maintain.",
