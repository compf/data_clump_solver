    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, indicating that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods and likely multiple classes. This repetition suggests that there is a strong relationship between these parameters, and they are frequently used together in the context of consumer lag statistics. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would significantly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase. It would also make it easier to extend or modify the behavior related to consumer lag statistics in the future.",
