    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, which indicates that the same set of parameters (group, topic, queueId) is being used across multiple methods in the ConsumerLagCalculator class. This repetition suggests that these parameters are closely related and are being passed around together frequently, leading to code duplication and potentially making the code harder to maintain or modify. By refactoring this data clump into a single class, we can encapsulate the related data and reduce the duplication of parameter lists across methods.",
