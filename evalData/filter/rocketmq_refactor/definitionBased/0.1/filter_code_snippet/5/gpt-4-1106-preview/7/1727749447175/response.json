    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence rate with 3558 occurrences across 32 affected files. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication that could benefit significantly from refactoring. By addressing this data clump, we can reduce the risk of bugs and inconsistencies, improve code maintainability, and potentially simplify the addition of new features that rely on these parameters."
