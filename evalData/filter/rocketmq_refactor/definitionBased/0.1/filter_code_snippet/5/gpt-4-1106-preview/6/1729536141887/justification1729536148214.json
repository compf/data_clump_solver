  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 is chosen for refactoring due to its high occurrence, which indicates significant duplication across the codebase. This clump involves the parameters 'String group', 'String topic', and 'int queueId', which are used in methods related to consumer lag statistics and message counting. The high frequency of these parameters being used together (60 occurrences across 32 affected files) suggests that they represent a common concept within the domain of message queue management. By extracting these parameters into a separate class, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make future changes to this concept more manageable.",
