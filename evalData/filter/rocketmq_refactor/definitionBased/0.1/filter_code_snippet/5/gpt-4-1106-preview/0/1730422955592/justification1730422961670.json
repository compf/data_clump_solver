  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 is present in multiple files, indicating that the same set of configuration parameters is being used across different components of the system. This widespread use suggests that these parameters are fundamental to the system's configuration and are likely to be modified and accessed frequently. By refactoring this data clump into a single configuration class, we can reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency across the system.",
