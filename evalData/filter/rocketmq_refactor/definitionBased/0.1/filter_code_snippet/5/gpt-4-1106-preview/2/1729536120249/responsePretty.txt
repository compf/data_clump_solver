    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, indicating that the group, topic, and queueId parameters are used together frequently across multiple methods. This repetition suggests that these parameters are closely related and represent a concept within the domain that could be encapsulated in a class. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce duplication and improve the code's maintainability.",
