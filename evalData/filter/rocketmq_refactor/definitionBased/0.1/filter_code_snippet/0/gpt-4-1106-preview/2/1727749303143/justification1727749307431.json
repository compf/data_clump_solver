  "key": "59",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 3558 times across 32 affected files. This indicates a significant amount of duplication and potential for errors due to the repeated use of the same parameter group. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure could greatly reduce the complexity of the codebase, improve maintainability, and decrease the likelihood of bugs related to these parameters."
