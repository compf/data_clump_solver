    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 includes configuration properties that are common across multiple classes (BrokerConfig.java and ProxyConfig.java). This clump affects multiple files and is likely to be part of a common configuration domain, which suggests that these properties should be encapsulated within a single configuration class to promote reuse and reduce duplication across the codebase.",
