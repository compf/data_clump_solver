  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 3558, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across 32 affected files. Refactoring this data clump would greatly reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and potentially prevent bugs related to the repeated use of the 'group', 'topic', 'queueId' parameters in methods related to consumer lag statistics. The high occurrence also suggests that these parameters are central to the domain logic, and encapsulating them could lead to a more understandable and cleaner codebase."
