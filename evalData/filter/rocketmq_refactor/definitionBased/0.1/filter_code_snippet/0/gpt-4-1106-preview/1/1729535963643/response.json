    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a high occurrence count of 60, indicating that the group, topic, and queueId parameters are used together very frequently across multiple files. This suggests that there is significant duplication of these parameters throughout the codebase, which can lead to maintenance issues and make the code less readable. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate these parameters into a single class, which can then be passed around, reducing duplication and improving the code structure.",
