    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 includes configuration properties that are common across multiple classes (BrokerConfig and ProxyConfig). This clump affects multiple files, indicating that the configuration settings are shared across different parts of the system. Refactoring this clump into a shared configuration class would reduce duplication and centralize the configuration management, making the system easier to maintain and understand.",
