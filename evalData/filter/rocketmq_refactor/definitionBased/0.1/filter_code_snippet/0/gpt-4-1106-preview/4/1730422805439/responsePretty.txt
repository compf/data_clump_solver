    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 43 includes configuration properties that are common across multiple classes (BrokerConfig.java and ProxyConfig.java). This clump affects multiple files and is likely to be used in various parts of the system where broker and proxy configurations are needed. Refactoring this clump into a single configuration class can improve maintainability and reduce the risk of inconsistencies across different parts of the application.",
