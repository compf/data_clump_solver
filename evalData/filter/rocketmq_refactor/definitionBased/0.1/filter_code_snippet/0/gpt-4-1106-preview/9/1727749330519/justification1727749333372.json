  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 59 has a very high occurrence rate with 3558 instances across 32 affected files. This indicates a significant amount of duplication and a high impact on the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a more maintainable and less error-prone code by reducing the duplication and potentially simplifying the interfaces between methods and classes."
