    "justification": "The data clump with key 59 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates that the group, topic, and queueId parameters are used together in multiple places across the codebase. This frequent repetition suggests that these parameters are closely related and represent a concept in the domain that could be encapsulated in a single class. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make future changes to this group of parameters easier to manage.",
