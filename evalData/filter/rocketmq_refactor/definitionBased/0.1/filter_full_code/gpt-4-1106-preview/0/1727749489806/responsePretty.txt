justification:"
The `enableMixedMessageType` field in the `BrokerConfig` class is a configuration option that determines whether the broker allows mixed message types (e.g., normal messages and transactional messages) to coexist in the same topic. Extracting this field into a separate class could encapsulate the message type handling logic and make it easier to manage and extend in the future, especially if more message types or related configurations are introduced.
