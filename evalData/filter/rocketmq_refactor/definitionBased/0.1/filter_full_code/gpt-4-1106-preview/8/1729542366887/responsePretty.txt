    "justification":"These files contain common fields such as 'brokerName', 'brokerAddr', 'clusterName', 'topic', 'group', which are repeatedly used across different classes and methods. These fields are fundamental in identifying and managing the messaging entities in RocketMQ, such as brokers, clusters, topics, and consumer groups. Refactoring these into a class could reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
