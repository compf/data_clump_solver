    "justification":"The common fields 'clusterName', 'brokerName', 'brokerId', 'brokerAddr' appear in multiple classes across different packages, indicating a high occurrence of data clump. These fields are related to broker configuration and identification, and are used in various operations such as metrics calculation, broker communication, message handling, and consumer examples. Refactoring these fields into a single class would centralize broker identity management and reduce code duplication.",
