reason:"
domain
",
justification:"
The `enableMixedMessageType` field in the `BrokerConfig` class is related to the domain of message types, which indicates whether the broker allows mixed message types (e.g., FIFO and non-FIFO messages) to coexist in the same topic. This is a domain-specific configuration that affects how messages are handled and stored by the broker. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class could encapsulate the behavior related to message type handling and improve the domain model of the broker configuration.
