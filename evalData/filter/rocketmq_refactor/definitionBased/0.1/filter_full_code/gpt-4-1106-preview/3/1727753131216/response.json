    "justification":"The `enableMixedMessageType` field in the `BrokerConfig` class is a configuration option that determines whether the broker allows mixed message types (e.g., normal messages and transactional messages) to be stored in the same message log. This is a domain-specific setting that affects how the broker handles different types of messages, and extracting it into a separate class could improve the clarity and maintainability of the code related to message type handling."
