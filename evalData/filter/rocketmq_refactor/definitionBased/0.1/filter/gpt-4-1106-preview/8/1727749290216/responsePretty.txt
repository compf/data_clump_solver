justification:"
The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields (25 in total) between the Stats and BrokerStatsManager classes. This large number of common fields indicates a high potential for code duplication and suggests that these fields are related to a common concept that could be encapsulated in a separate class. Refactoring this data clump would likely improve code maintainability and readability by reducing duplication and clarifying the relationship between these fields.
