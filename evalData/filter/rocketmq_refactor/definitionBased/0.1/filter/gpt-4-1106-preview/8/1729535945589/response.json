    "justification":"The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields (25 fields) between two classes, which indicates a large amount of duplicated data structure. This not only violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle but also suggests that these fields are likely to be related and represent a single concept or entity within the domain. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and clarify the domain model.",
