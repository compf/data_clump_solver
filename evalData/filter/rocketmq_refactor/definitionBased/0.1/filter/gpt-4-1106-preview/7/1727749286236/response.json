    "justification":"The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields (24 fields) between the Stats class and the BrokerStatsManager class. This large number of common fields suggests a high degree of duplication and tight coupling between these two classes. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class or a set of classes could greatly reduce duplication, improve code maintainability, and make the system more modular. By encapsulating these fields, we can also simplify the interfaces of the classes involved, making them easier to understand and work with."
