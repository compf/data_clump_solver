    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 0 has a significant number of common fields (25 fields) between two classes, which indicates a large amount of duplicated data structure. This can lead to maintenance issues, as changes to this common structure must be replicated across multiple locations. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate the common fields into a single class, which will improve code maintainability and reduce the risk of inconsistencies.",
