    "justification": "The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields between two classes (Stats and BrokerStatsManager), which indicates a large size of duplication. Refactoring this clump could greatly reduce redundancy and improve maintainability by potentially creating a new class or a constant class that encapsulates these common fields."
