justification:"
The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields between two classes, which indicates a large amount of duplicated data structure. Refactoring this data clump can greatly reduce redundancy and improve maintainability by potentially introducing a new class or a constant class that encapsulates these common fields. This will also make the codebase more coherent and easier to understand, as the related constants will be grouped together meaningfully.
