justification:"
The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields (25 fields) between two classes, which indicates a large amount of duplicated data structure. This can lead to code that is harder to maintain and understand. Refactoring this data clump by extracting these fields into a separate class or using a shared constant class could greatly reduce duplication and improve the codebase's modularity.
