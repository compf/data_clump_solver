justification:"
The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields between two classes (Stats and BrokerStatsManager), indicating a large clump size. This suggests a high potential for creating a more cohesive and reusable abstraction, such as a dedicated class to encapsulate these fields. Refactoring this data clump could greatly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase.
