    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 0 involves a significant number of fields (25 in total) that are common between two classes (Stats and BrokerStatsManager). This large number of common fields suggests a high degree of coupling between these classes, which can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and understand. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate these fields into a single class, which can then be used in both Stats and BrokerStatsManager. This will reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make the codebase more modular.",
