    "justification": "The data clump with key 0 has a significant number of common fields (25 in total) between two classes, which indicates a large amount of duplicated data structure. This can lead to maintenance issues, as changes to this common structure must be replicated across multiple locations. Refactoring this data clump by extracting these fields into a shared class or struct can greatly reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make the codebase easier to maintain."
