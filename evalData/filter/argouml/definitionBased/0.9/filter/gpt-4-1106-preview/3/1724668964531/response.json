Having multiple parameters that are common between these methods often indicates that these parameters should be encapsulated into a single object representing the context for creating diagram elements. This would improve the readability of method signatures, make them less error-prone to changes in the number of parameters, and simplify the method calls throughout the system. Refactoring this data clump could potentially benefit the maintainability of the code related to activity diagram rendering.\"\n}",
