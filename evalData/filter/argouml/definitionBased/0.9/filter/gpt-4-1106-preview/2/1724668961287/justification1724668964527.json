  "key": "29",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 29 is chosen for refactoring because it shows a significant clumping of five fields across two different test classes (TestCrInvalidHistory and TestCrInvalidInitial). This indicates a high level of duplication and probable misuse of inheritance or composition. Refactoring this clump may involve creating a common base class or utility methods for these tests, which can lead to better maintainability and extensibility of the test code."
