  "justification": "The data clump between common fields in 'TestCrInvalidHistory' and 'TestCrInvalidInitial' classes indicates a potentially high level of coupling between two different test classes, which could suggest that the tests are not sufficiently isolated. Additionally, this clump involves five common fields, which is a relatively large number that may signify a significant design issue. Refactoring to address this data clump may involve creating a base test class or a test helper that encapsulates the shared state, leading to more maintainable and understandable test code."
