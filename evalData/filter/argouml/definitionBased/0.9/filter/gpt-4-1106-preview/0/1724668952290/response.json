Since this clump indicates shared state across different test cases, it is very relevant to consider refactoring. Test cases often need to set up similar objects or state configurations, and these shared fields imply a common setup that could be centralized to reduce duplication and improve maintainability of the tests. Having a shared fixture or a common superclass that encapsulates the setup logic for these fields would simplify updates when the system under test changes and reduce the chance of diverging test setups for similar scenarios. Additionally, clearer and more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) test code increases readability and simplifies the process of writing new test cases.\"\n}",
