  "key": "13",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 13 appears to be the most significant for refactoring as it has the highest occurrence metric (144 occurrences), which indicates it is a common clump within the codebase. The parameters 'assocStart', 'assocEnd', and 'nav' are used across two methods, newActionNavigability and getDescription, within the same class, indicating tight coupling between these parameters. Refactoring this data clump by creating a new class to encapsulate these parameters could improve code readability and maintainability by reducing duplication and making the relationship between these parameters explicit."
