This indicates a high level of coupling and duplication of logic related to state machines and their components. Refactoring this clump would improve the design of the test cases, making them more maintainable and potentially revealing a more general abstraction that represents the state components in a unified way. This could lead to better code organization and the ability to reuse code more effectively. The impact of such a refactoring could be wide-reaching, as it affects both the tests and the code that operates with state machines, which are fundamental in modeling software behavior.\"\n}",
