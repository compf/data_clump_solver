  "justification": "The chosen data clump has a slightly higher occurrence (138) compared to others which have 136, indicating it might be a more frequent pattern in the codebase and potentially causing a higher degree of redundancy. Furthermore, the data clump is between two methods in the same class dealing with navigability, which likely means that the parameters are conceptually related, and refactoring could improve code readability and maintainability. By abstracting these parameters into a single object, we can make the code cleaner and reduce the chance of errors when calling these methods."
