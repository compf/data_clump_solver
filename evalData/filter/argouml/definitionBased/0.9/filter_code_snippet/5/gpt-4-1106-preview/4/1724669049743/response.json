The parameters 'assocStart', 'assocEnd', and 'nav' are used across two methods, newActionNavigability and getDescription, within the same class, indicating tight coupling between these parameters. Refactoring this data clump by creating a new class to encapsulate these parameters could improve code readability and maintainability by reducing duplication and making the relationship between these parameters explicit.\"\n}\n",
