This data clump involves four fields, a higher number compared to other data clumps which have only three common elements. Refactoring this clump would likely yield a new abstraction that could be reused across tests, reducing duplication and possibly uncovering a model or domain concept that is not yet well represented. Additionally, improving test code is often beneficial because it makes tests more readable and maintainable, which is crucial for ongoing development and refactoring.\"\n}",
