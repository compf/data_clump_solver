By addressing this clump, we can encapsulate the parameters assocStart, assocEnd, and nav into a single object, improving the code readability, maintainability, and eliminating the repeated group of parameters across methods. The impact of making this change is likely to be substantial given its frequent occurrence, indicating that this clump is integral to the codebase and thus prioritizing it could yield significant benefits.\"\n}",
