The affected classes are 'TestCrInvalidHistory' and 'TestCrInvalidInitial', both of which deal with critical criticism tests for states in UML diagrams and likely share a common context. Refactoring this clump could improve the design by promoting reusability and reducing redundancy across test classes related to state validation. This could lead to more maintainable and readable test code by introducing a base class or utility methods for shared state setup, reducing the risk of divergent changes and potential defects.\"\n}\n",
