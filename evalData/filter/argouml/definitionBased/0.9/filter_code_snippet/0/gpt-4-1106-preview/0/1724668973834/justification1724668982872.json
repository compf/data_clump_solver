  "key": "16",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 16 presents a case of common fields within a class that are also parameters in methods of another class, which suggests that these fields represent a concept that should be encapsulated in their own class. Refactoring such a data clump could not only improve code readability and maintainability but also ensure a higher level of abstraction, thereby promoting better design principles in the codebase. The number of occurrences (114) indicates that this refactoring could have a significant impact on the code quality and consistency throughout the project. Moreover, given that the data clump appears in test classes, addressing it could lead to more understandable and maintainable tests, which is crucial for effective testing strategies."
