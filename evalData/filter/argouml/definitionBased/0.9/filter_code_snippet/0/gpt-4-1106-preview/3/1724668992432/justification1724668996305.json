  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 4 is most important to refactor because it has the highest size (5 common fields) along with a high occurrence (120 times). While occurrence is similar across many snippets, the size of this data clump implies that there's a larger set of data that is passed around together which could greatly benefit from encapsulation into a single cohesive class. This could potentially simplify the interaction between various parts of the system related to the states and critiquing mechanisms in the application, leading to more maintainable and readable code."
