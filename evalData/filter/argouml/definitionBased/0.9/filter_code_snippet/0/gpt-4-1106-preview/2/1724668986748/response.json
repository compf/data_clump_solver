Refactoring this clump can potentially reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make maintenance easier. This clump affects two files and has a high occurrence rate (118), which indicates that it's a repeating pattern that if addressed, could lead to significant improvements. Moreover, sharing common test setup data across different tests often leads to the creation of a base test class or a test utility, reducing the chance of inconsistencies and errors in future test developments.\"\n}",
