  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 4 shows the existence of the same four fields across two different test classes (TestCrInvalidInitial and TestCrNoInitialState). Refactoring this clump can potentially reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make maintenance easier. This clump affects two files and has a high occurrence rate (118), which indicates that it's a repeating pattern that if addressed, could lead to significant improvements. Moreover, sharing common test setup data across different tests often leads to the creation of a base test class or a test utility, reducing the chance of inconsistencies and errors in future test developments."
