  "key": "12",
  "justification": "The data clump with the key 12 is found in two test classes where a number of object fields such as 'statemachine', 'compositestate', and 'initial' are repeated. This clump has a relatively high impact with an occurrence of 132 and affects 2 different files. While refactoring this data clump may not have user-facing implications, it is crucial for maintainability and understandability of the test code. By creating a test helper or fixture object that encapsulates these common fields, the tests would become cleaner, reduce duplication, and be easier to extend in the future. This is important for test code as it helps ensure that any changes to the underlying model require changes in only one place rather than in every test, reducing the chance of introducing errors during refactoring or extension of the test cases."
