Given that test classes often reflect the structure and concepts of the production code, this data clump may indicate a deeper issue in the domain model that should be addressed. Refactoring this clump could improve both test and production code maintainability by creating a more coherent representation of state objects and their interactions within statemachines and compositestates.\"\n}",
