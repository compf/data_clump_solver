  "key": "4",
  "justification": "Data clump with key 4 is found in two different test classes 'TestCrInvalidHistory' and 'TestCrInvalidInitial', which both contain five common fields: 'critic', 'statemachine', 'compositestate', 'state1', and 'state2'. The occurrence is high (128), affecting two separate files, and having a size of 5, which indicates a strong relationship between the fields. Refactoring this data clump into a shared superclass or a helper class could lead to better maintenance and reduce code duplication. Additionally, in a testing context, removing such duplication is particularly beneficial as it simplifies test setup and teardown processes, leading to more readable and maintainable tests."
