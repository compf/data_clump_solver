These classes likely deal with the validation of the state machine's semantics. Since these are tests for presumably similar state machine components, refactoring this data clump into a shared base class or a helper component could remove redundancy and improve the maintainability of the test code. Refactoring tests is crucial for ensuring long-term sustainability and understandability of the tests. Moreover, the metrics indicate a high occurrence (126) and affect two different files, which suggests that addressing this data clump could reduce duplication across these two test classes that are likely to be related in functionality.\"\n}\n",
