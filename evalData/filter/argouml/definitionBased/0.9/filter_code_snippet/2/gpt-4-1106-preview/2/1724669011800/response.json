The occurrence is high (128), affecting two separate files, and having a size of 5, which indicates a strong relationship between the fields. Refactoring this data clump into a shared superclass or a helper class could lead to better maintenance and reduce code duplication. Additionally, in a testing context, removing such duplication is particularly beneficial as it simplifies test setup and teardown processes, leading to more readable and maintainable tests.\"\n}",
