This high occurrence indicates that the parameters 'assocStart,' 'assocEnd,' and 'nav' are repeatedly used together, which may signify that they represent a concept that could be extracted into a new class or structure. Refactoring this data clump could significantly reduce duplication and improve the cohesion of the methods involved in navigation actions within the system, potentially leading to easier maintenance and further development. Moreover, the parameters seem to belong to the domain of associations and navigability in UML diagrams, which is a core concept in the ArgoUML application, hence enhancing clarity in this part of the codebase would be especially beneficial.\"\n}",
