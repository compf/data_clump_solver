These fields represent a state machine, its composite state, and an initial pseudostate, which are used in the setup for each test case. This clump suggests that there is a common concept or structure that is being replicated across these tests, which could be refactored into a shared setup method or a test fixture class to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.\"\n}",
