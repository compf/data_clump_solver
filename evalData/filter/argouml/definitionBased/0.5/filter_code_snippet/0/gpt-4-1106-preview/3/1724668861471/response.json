This indicates that there is a strong coupling between these classes based on the shared fields. Refactoring this data clump could lead to a better design by potentially introducing a new class that encapsulates these fields, thus promoting reuse and reducing duplication. Additionally, since the occurrence is high (70) across two affected files, addressing this data clump could have a significant impact on the maintainability and readability of the codebase.\"\n}",
