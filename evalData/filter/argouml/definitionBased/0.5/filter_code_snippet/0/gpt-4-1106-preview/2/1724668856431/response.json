Since test code is often replicated across different test cases and test classes, addressing this data clump can significantly reduce the redundancy and improve the maintainability of the test suite. Refactoring this clump may involve creating helper methods or a shared test fixture to encapsulate the common setup logic, thus making the tests cleaner and easier to understand. Moreover, the occurrence count of 68 suggests that this clump appears frequently, and the size of 4 indicates a relatively large clump, further emphasizing the potential impact of the refactoring.\"\n}",
