  "key": "23",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 23 has the highest occurrence metric of 74, which indicates that the common parameters 'assocStart', 'assocEnd', and 'nav' are used frequently across the codebase. This suggests that there is a strong relationship between these parameters that could be encapsulated in a single object to improve code maintainability and readability. Refactoring this data clump could potentially have the most significant impact on reducing code duplication and improving the design of the system."
