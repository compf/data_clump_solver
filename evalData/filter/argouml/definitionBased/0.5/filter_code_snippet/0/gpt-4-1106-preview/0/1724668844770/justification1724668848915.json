  "key": "8",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 8 has the highest occurrence count (64) and affects two files, which suggests it is a common pattern that could benefit from refactoring. It consists of five common fields across two test classes, which indicates these fields are likely related and could represent a single concept or entity. Refactoring this clump into a separate class or structure could improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of errors when these fields are used together."
