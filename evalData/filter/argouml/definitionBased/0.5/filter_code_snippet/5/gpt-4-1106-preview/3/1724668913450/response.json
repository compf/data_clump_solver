Refactoring this data clump into a single object would not only improve code readability and maintainability but also make it easier to manage the test setup and any changes to the underlying model in the future. Since tests are crucial for ensuring software quality, it is important to keep them as clean and understandable as possible. Moreover, the metrics show a high occurrence (90) and size (4), which means that this clump has a significant impact on the codebase.\"\n}",
