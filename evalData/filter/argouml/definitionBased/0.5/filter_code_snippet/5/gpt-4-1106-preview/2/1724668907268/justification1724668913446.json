  "key": "27",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 27 has a high occurrence of 90, which indicates that it is a commonly recurring structure in the code. The clump includes three parameters (assocStart, assocEnd, nav) that are used in both the 'newActionNavigability' factory method and the 'getDescription' helper method within the 'ActionNavigability' class. Refactoring this data clump into a single object could improve code readability and maintainability by reducing the number of parameters passed around and encapsulating the related data. Additionally, by creating a new class to represent this clump, we can likely define behavior related to the navigation action, which would enhance the object-oriented design of the system."
