  "key": "12",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 12 indicates the presence of at least three common fields in a class that are also parameters of a method in another class, which suggests strong coupling and redundancy. The fields 'statemachine', 'compositestate', and 'initial' are repeated in both the 'TestCrInvalidInitial' and 'TestCrNoInitialState' classes. Refactoring this data clump by creating a shared class or structure to encapsulate these common fields could improve the maintainability and readability of the code by reducing duplication and making the relationships between these concepts more explicit. Additionally, having a high occurrence metric of 84 suggests that this clump has a significant impact on the codebase, making it a prime candidate for refactoring."
