This clump has the highest occurrence of 92 and affects 2 files, which suggests that it is a common pattern that is likely duplicated across various parts of the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or a structure would simplify the code by reducing duplication, improving maintainability, and potentially making it easier to extend these classes in the future. This change could have a significant impact on the overall design and could help in preventing future bugs or inconsistencies in handling these related pieces of data.\"\n}",
