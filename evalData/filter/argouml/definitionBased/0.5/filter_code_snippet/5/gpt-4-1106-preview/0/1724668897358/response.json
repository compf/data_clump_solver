The fields 'statemachine', 'compositestate', and 'initial' are repeated in both the 'TestCrInvalidInitial' and 'TestCrNoInitialState' classes. Refactoring this data clump by creating a shared class or structure to encapsulate these common fields could improve the maintainability and readability of the code by reducing duplication and making the relationships between these concepts more explicit. Additionally, having a high occurrence metric of 84 suggests that this clump has a significant impact on the codebase, making it a prime candidate for refactoring.\"\n}",
