Since the fields represent elements of a state machine (statemachine, compositestate, initial), it suggests that these tests are dealing with similar setups or configurations for a state machine. Refactoring this data clump into a single class could improve the maintainability and readability of the tests by reducing duplication and making the relationship between these elements explicit. This could also simplify the setup for future tests related to state machines and make it easier to understand and modify the testing code as the system evolves.\"\n}",
