This clump affects two files and has an occurrence count of 78, indicating that the fields are likely used across various tests and possibly in conjunction with methods in the main application. Refactoring this data clump can improve the maintainability of the tests by reducing duplication and making it easier to understand the relationship between the test setup and the system under test. By introducing a test fixture or a helper method that encapsulates these fields, the test code can become cleaner, and any changes to the related functionality would be easier to manage. Additionally, since these fields represent significant concepts in the domain of state machines (statemachine, compositestate, history), consolidating them into a meaningful abstraction can improve the semantic clarity of the test code.\"\n}",
