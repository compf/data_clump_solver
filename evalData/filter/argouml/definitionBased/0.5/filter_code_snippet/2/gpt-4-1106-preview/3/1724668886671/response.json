This data clump is chosen because it not only occurs in a single class, which makes the refactoring scope smaller and more contained, but it also has a high occurrence metric (82), indicating that the clump is prevalent throughout the code. Refactoring this data clump into a single cohesive structure, such as a class or a structure that encapsulates these three parameters, could greatly reduce the complexity of the method signatures, improve code readability, and facilitate future maintenance or changes to this part of the system.\"\n}",
