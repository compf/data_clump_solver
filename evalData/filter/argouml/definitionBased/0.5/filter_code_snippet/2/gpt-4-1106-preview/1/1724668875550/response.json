This duplication suggests that the test code could benefit significantly from a refactoring to extract this common setup into a shared method or a test fixture class. By addressing this data clump, we can improve the maintainability of the test code, reduce redundancy, and make future changes to the state machine setup easier to manage across multiple test cases. Since tests are crucial for ensuring the correctness of the codebase, refactoring this data clump could have a positive impact on the overall quality and reliability of the software.\"\n}\n",
