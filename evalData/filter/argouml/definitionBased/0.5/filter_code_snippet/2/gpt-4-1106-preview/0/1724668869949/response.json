This clump has a high occurrence count of 74 and affects multiple files, indicating that these fields are used frequently across the codebase. Refactoring this clump could improve code maintainability by reducing duplication and making the test classes more cohesive. Creating a base class or a test fixture that encapsulates these common fields could be beneficial for current and future tests that require these elements, thereby streamlining the test setup process and enhancing the readability of the test code.\"\n}",
