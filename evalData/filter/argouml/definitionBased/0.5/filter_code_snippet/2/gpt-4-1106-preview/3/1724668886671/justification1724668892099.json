  "key": "8",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 8 is found in the 'ActionNavigability' class and is related to methods 'newActionNavigability' and 'getDescription', both of which share at least three common parameters (assocStart, assocEnd, nav). This data clump is chosen because it not only occurs in a single class, which makes the refactoring scope smaller and more contained, but it also has a high occurrence metric (82), indicating that the clump is prevalent throughout the code. Refactoring this data clump into a single cohesive structure, such as a class or a structure that encapsulates these three parameters, could greatly reduce the complexity of the method signatures, improve code readability, and facilitate future maintenance or changes to this part of the system."
