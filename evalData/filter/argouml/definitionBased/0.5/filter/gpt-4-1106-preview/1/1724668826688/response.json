This suggests a high degree of commonality in the state being tested across different test cases. Refactoring this could lead to a better abstraction for the test setup, allowing for code reuse and reducing the potential for errors when changes are made to the tested functionality. Since these are test classes, ensuring that they are well-factored is important for maintaining the integrity of the test suite and making it easier to write new tests in the future.\"\n}",
