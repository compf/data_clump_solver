This is a strong indication of a high degree of coupling between these methods, which likely serve related functionality. Refactoring this data clump can improve the code's maintainability by reducing duplication and possibly extracting a new method or class that encapsulates the shared parameters 'assocStart', 'assocEnd', and 'nav'. Since these parameters are related to the navigability of associations, encapsulating them can lead to a more intuitive and cohesive representation of the concept within the codebase. This can also simplify the method signatures and make the code easier to understand and change.\"\n}",
