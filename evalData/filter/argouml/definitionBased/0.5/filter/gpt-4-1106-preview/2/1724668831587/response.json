This clump is particularly important to refactor because it is within the same class and directly affects the maintainability of the methods in that class. By extracting these parameters into a single object or by applying other refactoring techniques such as Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, we can reduce the duplication of code, make the code more readable, and simplify method signatures which in turn makes future changes less error-prone. Additionally, since these methods are part of the user interface diagram functionality, improving the clarity and maintainability of this code is likely to have a significant impact on the overall user experience.\"\n}",
