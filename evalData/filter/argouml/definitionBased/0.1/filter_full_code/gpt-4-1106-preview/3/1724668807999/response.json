Each of these methods has a similar structure and shares at least three common fields: 'GraphModel gm', 'Layer lay', and 'Object edge'. This repetition suggests that there is a potential for refactoring to improve code reuse and maintainability. By extracting a superclass or a helper method that encapsulates the common logic, we can reduce duplication and make the codebase more concise and easier to understand.\"\n}",
