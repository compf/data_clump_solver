  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 4 involves common fields across different test classes, which indicates a potential for shared test setup or utility methods. Refactoring this clump can improve maintainability and reduce duplication in test code, which is often prone to being copied and pasted. This can lead to cleaner, more understandable tests and can make it easier to update tests when the system under test changes."
