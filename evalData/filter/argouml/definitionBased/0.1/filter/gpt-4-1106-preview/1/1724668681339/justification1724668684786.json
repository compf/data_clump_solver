  "key": "41",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 41 is chosen because it involves a significant number of common fields (five) between two different classes, which indicates a high level of duplication and a strong candidate for a new abstraction. Refactoring this data clump can lead to better code maintainability and reduce the risk of errors when changes are made to these common fields. Creating a new class to encapsulate these fields would promote code reuse and simplify the design of the related classes."
