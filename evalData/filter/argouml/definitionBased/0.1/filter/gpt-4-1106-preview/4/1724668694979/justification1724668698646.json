  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 4 involves common fields across two different classes, which indicates a strong possibility of a missing class that encapsulates these fields. Refactoring this data clump by creating a new class to represent the common concept could improve the design by promoting better encapsulation, reducing duplication, and enhancing code maintainability. This is especially important if these fields represent a concept or entity that is central to the application's domain."
