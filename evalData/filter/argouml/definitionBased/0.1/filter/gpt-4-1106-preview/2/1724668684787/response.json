This indicates that these parameters are likely to be related and represent a concept that could be encapsulated into a single object. Refactoring this data clump can improve the design by reducing the parameter list, making the methods easier to understand and maintain, and facilitating changes to the shared concept in the future. Since these methods are part of the same class and are likely to be changed together, addressing this data clump can have immediate benefits for the cohesion of the 'CollabDiagramRenderer' class.\"\n}",
