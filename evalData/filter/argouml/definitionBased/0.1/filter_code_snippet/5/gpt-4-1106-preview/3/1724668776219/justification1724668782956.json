  "key": "28",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 28 is chosen because it has the highest occurrence metric (42) compared to the other data clumps, indicating that it is used more frequently throughout the codebase. This data clump involves three parameters (assocStart, assocEnd, nav) that are common between two methods in the same class, which suggests that these parameters are closely related and could be encapsulated into a single object to improve code readability and maintainability. Refactoring this data clump could potentially reduce the complexity of the methods involved and make the code easier to understand and modify in the future."
