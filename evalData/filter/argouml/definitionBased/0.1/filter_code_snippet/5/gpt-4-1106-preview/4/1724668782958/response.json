This repetition suggests that there is a potential for creating a shared test fixture or a helper class to manage the common objects, which would improve maintainability and reduce duplication. Refactoring this data clump could lead to more readable and maintainable test code, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the tests over time as the system evolves. Additionally, since tests often serve as documentation for the expected behavior of the system, having a clear and concise setup improves the understandability of the tests for other developers.\"\n}\n",
