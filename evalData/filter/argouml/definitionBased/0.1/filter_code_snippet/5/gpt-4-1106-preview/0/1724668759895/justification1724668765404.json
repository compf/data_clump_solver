  "key": "23",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 23 is identified in the 'ActionNavigability' class and involves the parameters 'assocStart', 'assocEnd', and 'nav'. This clump has the highest occurrence metric of 36, indicating that it is used frequently across the codebase. Refactoring this clump into a single object could significantly reduce the complexity of method signatures and improve code maintainability. Additionally, since these parameters are likely related to navigation actions within associations, encapsulating them into a single object could enhance the readability and understanding of the code related to association navigability."
