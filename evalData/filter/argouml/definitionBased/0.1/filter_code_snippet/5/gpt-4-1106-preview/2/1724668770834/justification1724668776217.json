  "key": "22",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 22 has the highest occurrence metric of 40, indicating that the common parameters 'assocStart', 'assocEnd', and 'nav' are used frequently across the two methods 'newActionNavigability' and 'getDescription'. This suggests that these parameters are tightly coupled and central to the functionality related to navigability actions. Refactoring this data clump into a single object could improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the risk of errors when these methods are modified or extended in the future. Additionally, since the parameters represent a concept of navigability within associations, encapsulating them could lead to a more intuitive and object-oriented design."
