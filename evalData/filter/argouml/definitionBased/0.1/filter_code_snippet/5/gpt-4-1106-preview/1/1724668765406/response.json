This clump has a high occurrence count of 36 and affects 2 files, indicating that these fields are likely used together frequently across the codebase. Refactoring this clump into a single object could improve code maintainability by reducing duplication and making the relationship between these fields explicit. Additionally, since this clump is present in test classes, it suggests that the same clump may also exist in the production code that these tests are covering, potentially amplifying the impact of the clump beyond the test suite itself.\"\n}",
