This suggests that these parameters are tightly coupled and central to the functionality related to navigability actions. Refactoring this data clump into a single object could improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the risk of errors when these methods are modified or extended in the future. Additionally, since the parameters represent a concept of navigability within associations, encapsulating them could lead to a more intuitive and object-oriented design.\"\n}",
