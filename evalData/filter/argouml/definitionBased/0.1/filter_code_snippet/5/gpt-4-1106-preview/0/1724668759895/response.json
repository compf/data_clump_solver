This clump has the highest occurrence metric of 36, indicating that it is used frequently across the codebase. Refactoring this clump into a single object could significantly reduce the complexity of method signatures and improve code maintainability. Additionally, since these parameters are likely related to navigation actions within associations, encapsulating them into a single object could enhance the readability and understanding of the code related to association navigability.\"\n}",
