This suggests a significant amount of duplication that could be abstracted into a shared superclass or a helper class to manage the common state machine and state objects. Refactoring this data clump would likely improve maintainability and reduce the potential for errors when changes are made to the common fields. Additionally, since these are test classes, simplifying the setup by removing duplication can make the tests easier to understand and maintain.\"\n}",
