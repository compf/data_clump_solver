This repeated setup could be refactored into a shared method or test fixture to reduce duplication and improve maintainability. Since tests often serve as documentation for the expected behavior of the system, having a clear and concise setup is crucial. Refactoring this data clump could also make it easier to understand the context of the tests and reduce the risk of errors when changes are made to the test setup.\"\n}",
