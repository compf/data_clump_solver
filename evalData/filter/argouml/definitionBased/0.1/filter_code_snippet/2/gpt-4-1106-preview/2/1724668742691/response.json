This clump has a high occurrence of 28, affecting two files, indicating that these fields are likely to be part of a common setup for tests related to state machines in UML diagrams. Refactoring this clump into a shared test setup class or a test helper could reduce duplication and improve maintainability. Moreover, since these are test classes, improving the test setup could make it easier to write new tests and understand existing ones, which is crucial for maintaining the quality of the codebase.\"\n}",
