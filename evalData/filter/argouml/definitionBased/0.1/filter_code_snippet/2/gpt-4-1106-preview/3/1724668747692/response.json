This clump has a high occurrence count of 30 and affects two files, indicating that it is a recurring pattern that is likely to be part of a common setup for tests in this domain. Refactoring this clump into a shared test fixture or a helper class could reduce duplication and improve maintainability. Moreover, since tests often serve as documentation for the expected behavior of the system, simplifying the test setup can make the tests easier to understand and maintain.\"\n}",
