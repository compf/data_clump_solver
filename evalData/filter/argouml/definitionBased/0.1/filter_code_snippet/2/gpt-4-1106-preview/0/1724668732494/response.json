This clump has a high occurrence count of 24 and affects 2 files, indicating that these fields are likely used together frequently. Refactoring this data clump into a single object would improve code maintainability by reducing duplication and making the relationship between these fields explicit. It would also simplify method signatures if these fields are commonly passed as parameters together, and it could potentially facilitate easier changes in the future if the concept they represent needs to be modified or extended.\"\n}",
