This clump is particularly important to refactor because it indicates a potential design issue in the test suite, where multiple tests are relying on the same setup data. Refactoring this clump could lead to more maintainable and understandable tests by extracting common test setup into a shared method or test fixture. Additionally, since this clump occurs in the test code, it is likely to be executed frequently during development, making the impact of the refactoring more significant in terms of reducing redundancy and potential for errors in test setup.\"\n}",
