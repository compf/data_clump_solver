This clump has a high occurrence of 22 and affects two files, indicating that it is a pattern that is repeated across multiple test cases. Refactoring this data clump could lead to the creation of a base test class or a test fixture that encapsulates these common fields, thereby reducing duplication and improving maintainability. Moreover, since this clump is in the test code, addressing it could make the tests more readable and easier to update, which is crucial for maintaining the quality of the tests as the system evolves.\"\n}\n",
