This clump has a high occurrence of 14 and affects 2 files, indicating that these fields are likely to be used together frequently. Refactoring this clump into a single object could simplify the test setup and make the tests more maintainable. Additionally, since tests often serve as examples for how to use the production code, improving the clarity and structure of the test code can have a positive impact on the overall codebase.\"\n}",
