Refactoring this data clump could lead to a significant reduction in code duplication and improve maintainability. The parameters 'assocStart', 'assocEnd', and 'nav' are used in both 'newActionNavigability' and 'getDescription' methods, suggesting that these pieces of data are closely related and could be encapsulated into a single object. This would simplify method signatures and make the code easier to understand and change.\"\n}",
