    "justification":"The data clump between TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto classes suggests a strong domain concept that is being used across different layers of the application. These classes share a significant number of fields related to task execution details, which indicates that they represent a common concept in the domain of task management. By extracting these fields into a separate class, we can encapsulate the task execution details, promote code reuse, and improve maintainability. This refactoring would also simplify the constructors and methods that currently require many parameters, making the code easier to understand and work with.",
