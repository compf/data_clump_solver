    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence across different layers of the application (controller and service layers). This indicates that the same set of parameters is being passed around in multiple places, which can lead to code duplication and increased risk of errors if changes are made. Refactoring this data clump into a shared object would simplify method signatures and promote code reuse.",
