    "justification":"The data clump between TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto classes suggests that there is a common domain concept that is not yet encapsulated in a class. These classes share a significant number of fields related to task execution details, which indicates that these fields are part of a larger concept related to task execution context. By extracting these fields into a separate class, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make the domain model more explicit.",
