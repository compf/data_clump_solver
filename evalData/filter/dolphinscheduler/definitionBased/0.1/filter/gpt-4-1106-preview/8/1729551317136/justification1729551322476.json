  "key": "197",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 197 represents a set of parameters (pageNo, searchVal, pageSize) that are used across different layers (controller and service) in the application. This is a common pattern for pagination and search functionality, which is likely to be used frequently throughout the application. Refactoring this data clump can reduce duplication and improve maintainability by providing a consistent way to handle pagination and search across different parts of the application.",
