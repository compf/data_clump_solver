    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 166 involves a significant number of fields related to task execution details that are common between the TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto classes. This suggests a strong domain concept that could be encapsulated in its own class. Refactoring this data clump would improve the code's maintainability and readability by centralizing task-related information, reducing duplication, and making the domain model more explicit.",
