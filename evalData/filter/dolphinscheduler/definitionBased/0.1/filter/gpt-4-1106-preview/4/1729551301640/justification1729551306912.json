  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 involves a significant number of fields that are common between the TaskInstance class and the TaskInstanceExecuteDto class. These fields represent the core attributes of a task instance and its execution details. By extracting these fields into a separate class, we can encapsulate the task-related data, improve code maintainability, and reduce the risk of inconsistencies between the two classes. This refactoring is particularly beneficial because it aligns with the domain-driven design principle, where domain concepts should be represented as coherent models.",
