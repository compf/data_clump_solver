    "justification":"The `accessTokenService` field is common across multiple methods in the `AccessTokenController` class. It is a service dependency that is used to handle access token-related operations. Extracting this field into a separate class would not make sense as it is a typical pattern in Spring applications to inject services into controllers. The service itself should be responsible for any refactoring related to access token logic, not the controller.",
