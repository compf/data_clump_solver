    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 consists of the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' which are used across multiple methods and classes, indicating frequent duplication and a strong case for refactoring. This clump appears in both the AccessTokenController and AccessTokenService, suggesting that it is a common pattern for pagination and search functionality in the access token-related features. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate the pagination and search logic, reduce duplication, and improve maintainability.",
