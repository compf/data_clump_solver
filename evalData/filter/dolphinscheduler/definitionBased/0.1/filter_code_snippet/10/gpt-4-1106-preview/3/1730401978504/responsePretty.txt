    "key": "197",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 involves the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', which are used across multiple methods and classes for pagination and search functionality. This clump occurs very often, leading to duplication and potential inconsistencies in how pagination and search are implemented across different features. Refactoring this clump into a single class would centralize the pagination logic, reduce duplication, and improve maintainability.",
