    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 has a high occurrence of 40, which indicates that the common parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' are used across 56 affected files. This suggests a significant amount of duplication and a strong case for refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce the risk of errors when changes are made to these parameters.",
