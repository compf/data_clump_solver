    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 involves a large number of fields that are common across the `TaskInstance` class and the `TaskInstanceExecuteDto` class. This clump occurs in the core domain of task execution, which is a central part of the system. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by encapsulating the common fields in a single class that can be used across the system. This would also make the codebase more coherent and easier to understand, as the related fields would be grouped together, representing the concept of a task instance more effectively.",
