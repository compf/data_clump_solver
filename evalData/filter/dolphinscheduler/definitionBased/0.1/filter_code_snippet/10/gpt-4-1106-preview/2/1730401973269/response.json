    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 consists of the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', which are used across multiple methods and classes for pagination and searching functionality. This clump is chosen due to its frequent occurrence, which leads to significant duplication of code and increases the risk of errors when making changes to the pagination or search features. By refactoring this data clump, we can centralize the pagination logic, reduce code duplication, and improve maintainability.",
