    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it occurs very often, with 40 occurrences, leading to significant duplication across 56 affected files. This indicates that the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' are commonly used together in pagination-related methods, which suggests that these parameters are part of a common pagination functionality. Refactoring this data clump into a single object would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by encapsulating pagination logic in one place.",
