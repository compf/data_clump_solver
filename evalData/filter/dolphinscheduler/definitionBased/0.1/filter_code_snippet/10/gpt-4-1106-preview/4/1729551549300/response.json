    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 involves the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', which are used in methods related to querying access tokens with pagination. This clump affects 56 files and occurs 40 times, indicating a widespread pattern that is repeated across many parts of the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the pagination logic, potentially in a PaginationParameters class or similar construct.",
