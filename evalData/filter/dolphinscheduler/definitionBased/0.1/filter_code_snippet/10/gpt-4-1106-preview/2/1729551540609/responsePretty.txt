    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it occurs very often, with 40 occurrences, leading to a significant amount of duplication across 56 affected files. This indicates that the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' are commonly used together in pagination-related methods, which suggests that these parameters could be encapsulated into a single object to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
