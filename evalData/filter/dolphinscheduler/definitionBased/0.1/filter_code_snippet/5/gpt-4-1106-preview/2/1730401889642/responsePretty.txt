    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 occurs in multiple classes (TaskInstance, TaskInstanceExecuteDto) and represents a significant amount of duplication. These fields represent the properties of a task instance, which are used across different layers of the application, from persistence (DAO) to data transfer objects (DTOs). Refactoring this data clump into a single class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
