    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which leads to significant duplication across the codebase. This clump involves the parameters 'User loginUser', 'String searchVal', 'Integer pageNo', and 'Integer pageSize', which are used in methods related to querying access token lists with pagination. The high occurrence of this clump suggests that it is a common operation in the system, and refactoring it into a single object would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
