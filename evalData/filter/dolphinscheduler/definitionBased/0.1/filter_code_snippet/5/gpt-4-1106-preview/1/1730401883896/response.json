    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is present in multiple classes (TaskInstance, TaskInstanceExecuteDto) and represents a significant portion of the TaskInstance domain. This clump occurs very often and leads to much duplication, which can make the code harder to maintain and understand. Refactoring this clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve the code's modularity.",
