  "key": "197",
  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 involves the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', which are used across multiple methods for pagination purposes. This clump affects 56 files and occurs 40 times, indicating a widespread pattern that is repeated throughout the codebase. Refactoring this clump into a single PaginationRequest object would greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing pagination logic. This change would make the code cleaner and more consistent, as well as simplify method signatures and usages.",
