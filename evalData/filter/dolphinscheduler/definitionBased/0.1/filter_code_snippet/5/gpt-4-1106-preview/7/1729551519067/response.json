    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence across the codebase, with 40 occurrences affecting 56 files. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication that, if refactored, could significantly reduce the complexity and improve the maintainability of the code. By extracting these parameters into a separate class, we can encapsulate the pagination logic and make the code cleaner and more reusable.",
