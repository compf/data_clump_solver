    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes, indicating significant duplication of the same group of fields. This clump appears in the TaskInstance, TaskInstanceExecuteDto, and related classes, suggesting that these fields are commonly used together to represent task-related information. Refactoring this clump into a single class would reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and enhance the clarity of the codebase.",
