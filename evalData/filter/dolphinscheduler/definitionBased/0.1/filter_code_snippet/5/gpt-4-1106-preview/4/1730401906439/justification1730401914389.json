  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is present in multiple classes (TaskInstance, TaskInstanceExecuteDto) and represents a significant amount of duplication across these classes. This clump includes fields such as id, name, taskType, processInstanceId, taskCode, taskDefinitionVersion, processInstanceName, state, firstSubmitTime, submitTime, startTime, endTime, host, executePath, logPath, retryTimes, alertFlag, pid, appLink, flag, duration, maxRetryTimes, retryInterval, taskInstancePriority, processInstancePriority, workerGroup, environmentCode, environmentConfig, executorId, varPool, executorName, delayTime, taskParams, dryRun, taskGroupId, cpuQuota, memoryMax, taskExecuteType. Refactoring this clump into a single class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
