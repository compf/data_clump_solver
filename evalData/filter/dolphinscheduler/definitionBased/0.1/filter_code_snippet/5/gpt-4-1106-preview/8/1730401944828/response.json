    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is present in multiple classes (TaskInstance, TaskInstanceExecuteDto) and represents a significant amount of duplication. These classes share a large number of common fields related to task instance details, which suggests that these fields are part of a common domain and are used together frequently. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the common fields and their associated behavior.",
