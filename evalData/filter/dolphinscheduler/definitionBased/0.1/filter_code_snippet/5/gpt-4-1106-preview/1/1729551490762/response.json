    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, which indicates a significant amount of duplication. Refactoring this data clump can greatly reduce the duplication and improve maintainability of the codebase. The parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' are used across various service and controller layers, suggesting that they are part of a common pagination functionality that could be encapsulated in a separate class or structure.",
