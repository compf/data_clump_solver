    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, leading to significant duplication. This clump involves the parameters 'User loginUser', 'String searchVal', 'Integer pageNo', and 'Integer pageSize', which are used in the pagination of access token lists. The frequent repetition of these parameters in method signatures suggests that they are a cohesive group that could be refactored into a single object to simplify method interfaces and reduce the risk of errors when passing around these related values.",
