  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, leading to significant duplication. This clump involves the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', which are used in pagination queries for access tokens. The frequent repetition of these parameters in method signatures suggests that they are a core part of the pagination functionality and could benefit from being refactored into a single object to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
