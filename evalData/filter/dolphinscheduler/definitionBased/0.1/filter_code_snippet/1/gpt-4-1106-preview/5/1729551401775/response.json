    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates that it leads to a significant amount of duplication across the codebase. This clump involves the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', which are used in pagination-related methods across 56 affected files and occur 40 times. Refactoring this clump into a single class would greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
