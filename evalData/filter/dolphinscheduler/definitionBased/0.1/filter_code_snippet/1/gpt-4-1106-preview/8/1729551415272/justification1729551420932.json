  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates that the common parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' are used very frequently across multiple files. This repetition suggests that there is a common functionality related to pagination and searching that could be encapsulated in a separate class or structure. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce duplication, improve code maintainability, and potentially simplify the method signatures that deal with pagination and search functionality.",
