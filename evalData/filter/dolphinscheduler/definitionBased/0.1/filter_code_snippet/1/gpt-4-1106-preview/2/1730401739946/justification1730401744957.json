  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is found in both the TaskInstance entity and TaskInstanceExecuteDto, which indicates that these fields are used across different layers of the application (DAO and DTO). This frequent repetition suggests that these fields are a core part of the domain model related to task instances and their execution. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
