    "key": "197",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, leading to significant duplication. The parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' are common across various methods and services, indicating a pattern that is frequently used for pagination and search functionality in the application. Refactoring this data clump into a single object would reduce duplication and improve code maintainability.",
