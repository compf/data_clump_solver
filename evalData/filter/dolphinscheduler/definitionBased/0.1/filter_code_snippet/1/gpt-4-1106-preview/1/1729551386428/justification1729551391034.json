  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates that the same group of parameters is used across many different methods and potentially different classes. This repetition can lead to code duplication and make the codebase harder to maintain. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce the duplication and improve the maintainability of the code.",
