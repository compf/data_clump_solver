  "justification": "The fields in the TaskInstance class and TaskInstanceExecuteDto class share a common domain related to task execution details. These fields represent the metadata and execution parameters of a task instance, which are essential for managing and tracking the execution of tasks within the system. By refactoring these fields into a separate class, we can encapsulate the task execution-related data, improve code readability, and facilitate potential changes to the task execution model in the future.",
