  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 represents a set of fields that are common across two different classes: TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto. This clump occurs in both the 'dolphinscheduler-dao' and 'dolphinscheduler-extract' modules, indicating that these fields are used in multiple places within the system. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the common fields and their associated behavior.",
