    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, leading to significant code duplication. This clump involves the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', which are used in pagination-related methods across the system. Refactoring this clump into a single object would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
