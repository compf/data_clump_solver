    "justification": "The fields in the TaskInstance class and TaskInstanceExecuteDto class share a common domain related to task execution details. These fields represent the metadata and state of a task instance, and they are used in multiple places, indicating that they belong to a specific bounded context. Refactoring these fields into a separate class would encapsulate the task instance data, improve code readability, and make the data easier to manage and maintain.",
