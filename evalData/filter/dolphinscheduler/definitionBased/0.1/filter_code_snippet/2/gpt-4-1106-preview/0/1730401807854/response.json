    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple classes. It represents a set of fields related to task instances, which are repeatedly defined in both entity and DTO classes. This repetition suggests that these fields are a core part of the domain model and are used frequently throughout the application, leading to significant duplication.",
