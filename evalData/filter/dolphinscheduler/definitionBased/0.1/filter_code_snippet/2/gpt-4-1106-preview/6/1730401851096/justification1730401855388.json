  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is present in multiple classes and methods, indicating a high level of duplication across different parts of the system. This clump includes fields related to task instances, such as 'id', 'name', 'taskType', 'processInstanceId', 'taskCode', 'taskDefinitionVersion', etc. Refactoring this clump into a single class would greatly reduce duplication and improve code maintainability.",
