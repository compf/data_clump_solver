    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates that it leads to a significant amount of duplication across the codebase. This clump involves the parameters 'User loginUser', 'String searchVal', 'Integer pageNo', and 'Integer pageSize', which are used in methods related to querying access tokens with pagination. The frequent repetition of these parameters in multiple methods across different files suggests that refactoring this clump into a single object would greatly reduce duplication and improve code maintainability.",
