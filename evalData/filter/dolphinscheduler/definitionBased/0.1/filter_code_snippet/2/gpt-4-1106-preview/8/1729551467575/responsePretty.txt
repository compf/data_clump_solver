    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it occurs very often, with 40 occurrences, leading to a significant amount of duplication. This clump involves the parameters 'User loginUser', 'String searchVal', 'Integer pageNo', and 'Integer pageSize', which are used in pagination queries across multiple services and controllers. Refactoring this clump into a single object would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
