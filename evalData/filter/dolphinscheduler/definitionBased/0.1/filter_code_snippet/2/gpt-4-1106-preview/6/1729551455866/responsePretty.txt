    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which indicates that the common parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' are used across 56 affected files with 40 occurrences. This suggests a significant amount of duplication and a strong case for refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce the potential for errors.",
