  "key": "166",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is present in multiple classes and methods, indicating that the same set of fields is being used repeatedly across different parts of the application. This repetition suggests that these fields are related and represent a concept that could be encapsulated in a single class. By refactoring this data clump into a class, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make the codebase easier to maintain.",
