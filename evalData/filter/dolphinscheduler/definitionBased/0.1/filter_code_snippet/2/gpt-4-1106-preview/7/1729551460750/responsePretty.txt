    "reason": "affected_files",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 involves the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', which are used across multiple methods for pagination purposes. This clump is chosen because it affects a significant number of files (56 files) and has a high occurrence (40 times), indicating that it is a common pattern throughout the codebase. Refactoring this clump into a single object would greatly reduce the duplication of these parameters across various methods and improve the maintainability of the code. By encapsulating these parameters into a single class, we can simplify method signatures and make the code cleaner and easier to understand.",
