    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is present in multiple classes and methods, indicating that the same group of fields is being used repeatedly across different parts of the application. This suggests that there is a common concept or entity that these fields represent, which is not currently encapsulated in a single class. Refactoring this data clump into a class would reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code by providing a single source of truth for the related fields.",
