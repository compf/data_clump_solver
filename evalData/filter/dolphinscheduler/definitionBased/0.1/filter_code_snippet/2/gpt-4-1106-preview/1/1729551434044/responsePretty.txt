    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it occurs very often (40 times) and affects a significant number of files (56 files). This indicates that the clump is a common pattern in the codebase and refactoring it could lead to a substantial reduction in code duplication. By introducing a new class or method that encapsulates these parameters, we can simplify method signatures and improve code maintainability.",
