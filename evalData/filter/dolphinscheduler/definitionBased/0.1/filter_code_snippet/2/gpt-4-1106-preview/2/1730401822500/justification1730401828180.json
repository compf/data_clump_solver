  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is present in multiple classes (TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto) and consists of a large number of common fields that are related to task execution details. This clump occurs multiple times, indicating a high level of duplication and a strong candidate for refactoring into a separate class to encapsulate task-related information.",
