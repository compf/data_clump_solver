  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 consists of multiple fields that are common across different classes, specifically TaskInstance.java and TaskInstanceExecuteDto.java. This clump affects multiple files and likely represents a core concept in the domain that could be better encapsulated in its own class. By refactoring this data clump, we can improve the maintainability and readability of the code, reduce duplication, and make the codebase more modular.",
