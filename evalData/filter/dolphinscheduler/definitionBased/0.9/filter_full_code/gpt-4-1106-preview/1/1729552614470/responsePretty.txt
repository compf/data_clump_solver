    "justification":"The code contains a pattern where multiple fields representing values related to database drivers (Driver, JDBC URLs, validation queries) are defined in one location, suggesting a common domain. Extracting these fields into a separate 'DatabaseDriver' class could encapsulate the database driver-related information and provide a more maintainable structure. It can also improve code readability and prevent data clumps across the codebase where these values might be reused.",
