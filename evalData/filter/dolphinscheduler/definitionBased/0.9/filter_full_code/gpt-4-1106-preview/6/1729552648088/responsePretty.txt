    "justification": "The three fields 'firstSubmitTime', 'submitTime', 'startTime', and 'endTime' are all related to date and time, and involve a significant number of lines indicating their common concept. They may also be used together in operations that deal with task scheduling and tracking. By extracting these into a separate class, code readability can be improved, and it can centralize all operations that manipulate these date fields.",
