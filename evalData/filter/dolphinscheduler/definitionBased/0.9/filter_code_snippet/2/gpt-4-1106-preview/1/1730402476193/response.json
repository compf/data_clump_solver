    "justification": "This data clump consists of fields related to task instance details and is repeated in multiple classes (TaskInstance, TaskInstanceExecuteDto). It occurs frequently and is a core part of the domain, which suggests that these fields are tightly related and represent a single concept in the domain. Refactoring this clump into a class can improve the code maintainability, reduce duplication, and enhance understandability.",
