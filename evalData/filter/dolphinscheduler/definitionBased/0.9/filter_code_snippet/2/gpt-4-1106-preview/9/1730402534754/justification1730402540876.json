  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 concerns the `TaskInstance` and `TaskInstanceExecuteDto` classes. Both classes contain similar fields such as `id`, `name`, `taskType`, `taskCode`, `state`, `retryTimes` and many others, which are related to the execution and maintenance of task instances. This clump involves multiple files and classes, thus affecting maintainability and readability across these. Extracting a common class to encapsulate these fields can reduce duplication, simplify the codebase, and improve code cohesiveness.",
