    "justification": "The data clump associated with the key '197' consists of a common set of parameters (User loginUser, String searchVal, Integer pageNo, Integer pageSize) that are used across multiple methods, affecting a significant number of files (56 files) and occurring with high frequency (40 occurrences). This indicates a widespread pattern of the same parameters being passed around in various parts of the codebase. Refactoring this data clump can lead to better maintainability and a reduced chance of bugs when changes to these common parameters are necessary. By introducing a parameter object or a context object encapsulating these frequently used parameters, we can simplify method signatures and ensure that related data is passed together consistently.",
