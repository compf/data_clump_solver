  "justification": "The fields (id, name, taskType, processInstanceId/taskGroupPriority/workflowInstanceId, taskCode, taskDefinitionVersion, state, firstSubmitTime, submitTime, startTime, endTime, host, executePath, logPath, retryTimes, alertFlag, pid, appLink, flag, duration, maxRetryTimes, retryInterval, taskInstancePriority, workflowInstancePriority, workerGroup, environmentCode, environmentConfig, executorId, varPool, executorName, delayTime, taskParams, dryRun, taskGroupId, cpuQuota, memoryMax, taskExecuteType) are found in two separate data classes (TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto) which suggest that they represent the same concept and are occurring multiple times. Extracting these into a single class can simplify the codebase by reducing repetition and improving maintainability.",
