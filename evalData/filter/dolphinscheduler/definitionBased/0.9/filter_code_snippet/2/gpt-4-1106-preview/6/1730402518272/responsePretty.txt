    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is a collection of common fields that appear in both the TaskInstance entity class and TaskInstanceExecuteDto class. The duplication of fields such as 'id', 'name', 'taskType', 'processInstanceId', 'taskCode', 'state', etc., suggests that these classes likely share significant portions of their data model. This clump occurs in multiple places, creating redundancy and a higher risk of errors in case changes need to be synchronized across these classes.",
