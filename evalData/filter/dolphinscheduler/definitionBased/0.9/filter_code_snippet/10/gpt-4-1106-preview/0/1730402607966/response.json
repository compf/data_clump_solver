    "justification": "TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto share several fields that are related to the execution details of a task instance, such as 'name', 'taskType', 'processInstanceId', 'taskCode', and so on. These fields represent a common domain that is pertinent to the execution context of a task instance in a workflow system. Refactoring these fields into a separate class can centralize and simplify the management of task instance data, which can be beneficial for tasks such as serialization, deserialization, persistence, and business logic implementation.",
