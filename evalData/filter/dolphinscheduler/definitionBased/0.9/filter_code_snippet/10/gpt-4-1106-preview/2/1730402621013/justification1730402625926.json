  "key": "201",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by the key '201' is present in multiple classes (EnvironmentDto, AccessToken) and is related to common attributes used for entity identification and audit purposes such as 'id', 'createTime', and 'updateTime'. This clump occurs very often, as almost every entity in a system needs these fields for database entity tracking. The repetitive nature of these fields in various classes can lead to code duplication and potential inconsistencies in how these common fields are handled across the system.",
