    "justification": "The fields `name`, `taskType`, `executePath`, and others are repeatedly used across both `TaskInstance` and `TaskInstanceExecuteDto` classes which suggests these classes are tightly coupled with respect to task instance data. This leads to duplication and suggests that a separate class encapsulating this common state would be beneficial.",
