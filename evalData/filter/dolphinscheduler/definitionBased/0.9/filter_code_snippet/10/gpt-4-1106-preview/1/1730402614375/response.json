    "justification": "The data clump involving common fields 'id', 'name', and 'createTime' across the AccessToken entity, EnvironmentDto and AccessToken service methods suggests that these fields are significant throughout different parts of the application such as DTOs, entities, and service layers. This widespread usage across files indicates the potential interconnection and reuse of these concepts, making this data clump important to refactor in order to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
