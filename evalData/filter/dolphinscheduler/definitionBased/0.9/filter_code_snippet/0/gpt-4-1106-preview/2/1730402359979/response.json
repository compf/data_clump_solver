    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 166 contains a large number of common fields between two different classes (TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto). These fields are used to represent the properties of a task instance in the application, which implies that they share a high level of cohesion and are prone to changes in unison. By refactoring this data clump, the code duplication can be reduced, ensuring that future changes to the task instance properties only need to be made in one place, reducing the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies. This will also make unit testing easier by allowing tests to focus on the extracted class instead of being duplicated across various locations.",
