  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 (accessToken pagination parameters) occurs in 40 different occurrences and affects 56 files, which suggests that it leads to significant duplication across a wide scope of the application. Refactoring these methods to use a shared object for pagination would eliminate repetitive code and reduce the chance of errors during future changes or additions to pagination features.",
