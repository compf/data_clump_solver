    "justification": "The data clump involving the parameters (User loginUser, String searchVal, Integer pageNo, Integer pageSize) is used across multiple methods and has a high occurrence rate, as indicated by its occurrence metric being 40. This suggests significant duplication of code where these parameters are used together. By encapsulating these parameters into a single class, we can reduce redundancy, improve code readability, and make it easier to maintain and extend the functionality related to access token pagination. It also aligns well with object-oriented design principles.",
