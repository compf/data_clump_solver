  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 (parameters 'User loginUser', 'String searchVal', 'Integer pageNo', 'Integer pageSize') affects a significant number of files (56) and occurs with high frequency (40 instances). This indicates that it is a widely used set of parameters across the codebase, and encapsulating them into a single object would reduce repetition and improve maintainability. By refactoring this data clump, changes to the related functionality would be more localized, and related code would be more cohesive.",
