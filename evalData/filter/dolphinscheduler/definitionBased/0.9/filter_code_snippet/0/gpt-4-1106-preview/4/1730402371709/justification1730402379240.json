  "justification": "The fields listed appear to be attributes describing a task instance in a workflow management context. These attributes repeatedly occur across two different classes, specifically 'TaskInstance.java' and 'TaskInstanceExecuteDto.java', representing the common data related to the execution details of a task. Extracting these fields into a separate domain-specific class would encapsulate the task execution data, simplify code changes related to task execution, and promote better reusability across various components that handle task execution data. It is common in the domain of workflow management systems to have a dedicated model for such execution details.",
