    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it occurs 40 times across 56 affected files. This indicates that a significant part of the codebase is affected by duplication, and addressing this data clump could result in a substantial reduction in code redundancy. Consolidating these parameters into a single object would simplify method signatures and improve maintainability.",
