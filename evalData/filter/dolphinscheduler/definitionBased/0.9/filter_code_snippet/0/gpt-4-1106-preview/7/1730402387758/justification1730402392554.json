  "justification": "Both the TaskInstance entity and TaskInstanceExecuteDto class contain the same fields representing the attributes of a task instance. The presence of common fields like 'name', 'taskType', 'taskCode', etc., in both classes indicates they are part of the Task instance domain and could benefit from being encapsulated within a separate class. This would allow for the reuse of the Task instance details across components and reduce the duplication of field definitions.",
