    "justification": "The class 'TaskInstance' and the class 'TaskInstanceExecuteDto' both have a high number of common fields (over three), which indicates repetitive data structure between two different classes. This repetition suggests a potential for a base class or a composite class that can encapsulate these common fields, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.",
