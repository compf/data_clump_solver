    "justification":"The fields such as 'name', 'taskType', 'taskCode', etc., found across both the `TaskInstance` class and `TaskInstanceExecuteDto` class, represent key domain concepts related to a task's execution context and metadata in a workflow system. By having these fields duplicated in two different classes, it signifies a strong conceptual link and suggests the potential for an underlying domain entity, which can be refactored into a common class to encapsulate task information. This not only organizes the domain model more effectively but also reduces duplication, making future changes more manageable and less error-prone.",
