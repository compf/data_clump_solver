    "justification": "This data clump, involving the pagination parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', occurs 40 times and affects 56 files, indicating widespread repetition throughout the codebase. Such repetition can be error-prone when changes need to be applied consistently across the many instances, and it adds to the maintenance burden. Refactoring this clump would improve code maintainability by centralizing pagination logic.",
