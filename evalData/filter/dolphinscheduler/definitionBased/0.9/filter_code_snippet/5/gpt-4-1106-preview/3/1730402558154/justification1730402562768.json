  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 166 is spread across multiple files, including TaskInstance.java, TaskInstanceExecuteDto.java, and others. It consists of several fields that are commonly used to define task instances. This repetition across multiple classes increases the risk of errors and makes maintenance harder. Refactoring this clump would improve code readability and reduce the chance of inconsistencies across the different representations of a task instance.",
