  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 represents a significant number of common fields in different classes (`TaskInstance.java`, `TaskInstanceExecuteDto.java`) that pertain to the description and execution details of a task instance. This repetition suggests that there is a core concept around task execution that is being duplicated and could be better abstracted into a shared class or structure. By refactoring these common fields into a single class, the code would become more maintainable, reduce redundancy, and increase the coherence of the task-related entities. Such a class would encapsulate all necessary properties of a task instance execution context, making the domain model clearer and reducing the likelihood of bugs when these fields are changed or extended.",
