  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is selected due to its high occurrence in the codebase. The data clump is encountered 40 times across 56 different files, suggesting significant code duplication and potential for errors if changes are made to the method signatures or handling of the associated parameters. Refactoring this data clump can significantly reduce duplication, improve code maintainability, and reduce the risk of bugs introduced by inconsistencies across multiple implementations.",
