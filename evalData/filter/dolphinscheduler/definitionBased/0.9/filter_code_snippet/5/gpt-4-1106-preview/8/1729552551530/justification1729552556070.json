  "justification": "Even if this data clump includes only 3 parameters which is the minimum count for a data clump, it is selected because it occurs very frequently, appearing in 40 occurrences which suggests there is a significant amount of code duplication due to this data clump. Refactoring it not only reduces this duplication but potentially makes the code more maintainable and less error-prone. It will also likely simplify the method signatures and possibly make the related APIs more consistent.",
