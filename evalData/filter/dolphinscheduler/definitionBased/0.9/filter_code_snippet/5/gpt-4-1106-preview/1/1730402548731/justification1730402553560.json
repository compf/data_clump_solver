  "key": "166",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump associated with the key '166' occurs in multiple classes where TaskInstance-related information is represented. This includes `TaskInstance`, `TaskInstanceExecuteDto`, and multiple constant definitions. The repeated occurrence of this data clump suggests that there is common functionality and data handling associated with task instances across classes. Encapsulating this in a single class would likely improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and enhance data consistency.",
