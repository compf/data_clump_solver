  "justification": "This data clump is chosen because its occurrence leads to significant duplication within the codebase. The combination of loginUser, searchVal, pageNo, and pageSize appears in 40 occurrences, which indicates that there is a common pattern of paginated data retrieval throughout the application. Refactoring this data clump can thus have a notable impact on reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.",
