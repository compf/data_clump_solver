    "justification":"The provided code snippets show a data clump with a significant number of common fields between the `TaskInstance`, `TaskInstanceExecuteDto`, and the Entity class `TaskInstance`. This clump stands out because of its large size, consisting of various fields related to task and execution metadata (e.g., id, name, taskType, workerGroup, environmentCode). Refactoring this clump into its own class would encapsulate the task information better, improve code readability, reduce redundancy, and facilitate maintenance and any future changes to the task representation.",
