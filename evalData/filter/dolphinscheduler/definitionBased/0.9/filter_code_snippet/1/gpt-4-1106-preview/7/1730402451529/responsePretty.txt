    "justification": "The clump of variables (name, taskType, taskCode, taskDefinitionVersion, firstSubmitTime, submitTime, startTime, endTime, host, executePath, logPath, retryTimes, pid, appLink, duration, maxRetryTimes, retryInterval, workerGroup, environmentCode, environmentConfig, executorId, varPool, executorName, delayTime, taskParams, dryRun, taskGroupId, cpuQuota, memoryMax) occurs in both TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto, indicating significant duplication of fields between two classes. This duplication can lead to higher maintenance effort and the risk of bugs when these shared concepts change and each occurrence has to be independently updated.",
