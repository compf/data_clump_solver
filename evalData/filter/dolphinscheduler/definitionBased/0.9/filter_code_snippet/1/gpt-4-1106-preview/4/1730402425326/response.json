    "justification": "The fields name, taskType, taskCode, taskDefinitionVersion, taskGroupPriority, firstSubmitTime, submitTime, startTime, endTime, host, executePath, logPath, retryTimes, pid, appLink, duration, maxRetryTimes, retryInterval, workerGroup, environmentCode, environmentConfig, executorId, varPool, executorName, delayTime, taskParams, dryRun, taskGroupId, cpuQuota, and memoryMax are present in both TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto classes, suggesting a close relationship and a common domain. These fields are related to the execution and definition of a task, thus encapsulating them into a single TaskDetails or TaskInformation class would manage related information cohesively, facilitating maintenance and reuse while reducing the duplication between these two classes.",
