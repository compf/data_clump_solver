    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is present across two different classes (TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto) with numerous fields that are common. This indicates a high level of duplication that can complicate maintainability and future changes. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate the shared fields into a single class, improving code reuse and decreasing the risk of bugs due to inconsistent updates across classes.",
