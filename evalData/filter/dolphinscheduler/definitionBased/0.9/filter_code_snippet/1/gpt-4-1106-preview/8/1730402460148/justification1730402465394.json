  "key": "166",
  "reason": "size",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 involves a large number of parameters shared between two classes (TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto). Each class has multiple fields such as 'name', 'taskType', 'taskCode', 'taskDefinitionVersion', and others, which are related to task instance information. This indicates a common structure that can be abstracted into a separate class to better encapsulate the task instance properties, reduce redundancy, and improve maintainability.",
