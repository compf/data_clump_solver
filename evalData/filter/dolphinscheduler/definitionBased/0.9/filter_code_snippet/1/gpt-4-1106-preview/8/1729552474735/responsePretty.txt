    "justification": "The data clump defined by the `loginUser`, `pageNo`, and `pageSize` parameters appears most frequently with 40 occurrences across 56 affected files. This indicates that the clump is a common pattern used throughout a significant portion of the application, leading to widespread duplication and potential for error if changes are required. Refactoring this clump would likely lead to cleaner code, easier maintenance, and reduced risk of inconsistency.",
