  "justification": "The selected data clump involves multiple fields (name, taskType, taskCode, taskDefinitionVersion, taskGroupPriority, firstSubmitTime, submitTime, startTime, endTime, host, executePath, logPath, retryTimes, pid, appLink, duration, maxRetryTimes, retryInterval, workerGroup, environmentCode, environmentConfig, executorId, varPool, executorName, delayTime, taskParams, dryRun, taskGroupId, cpuQuota, memoryMax) that are common across `TaskInstance` and `TaskInstanceExecuteDto` classes. This suggests a strong relationship between these fields and a common domain of task execution information. By extracting these into a separate class, we would encapsulate task execution details, improving code maintainability and readability.",
