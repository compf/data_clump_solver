  "justification": "The chosen data clump consists of parameters related to pagination (user, searchVal, pageNo, pageSize) and affects a significant number of files (56) with a high occurrence rate (40). This indicates that pagination is a common feature shared across various API endpoints, leading to repeated code which could be improved by extracting a class that encapsulates the pagination logic. This will increase maintainability and reduce the complexity of the codebase.",
