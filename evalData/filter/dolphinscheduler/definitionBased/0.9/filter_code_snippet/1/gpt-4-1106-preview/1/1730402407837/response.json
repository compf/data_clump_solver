    "justification":"The fields 'name', 'taskType', 'taskCode', 'taskDefinitionVersion', among others, represent a domain concept related to task instances that is mirrored across multiple classes. There is a strong coherence between these fields as they all pertain to the data associated with a task instance, which suggests a TaskInstance concept should be extracted as a class. Moreover, the repetition and spread of these fields across different classes increase the risk of inconsistencies and make the codebase more difficult to maintain.",
