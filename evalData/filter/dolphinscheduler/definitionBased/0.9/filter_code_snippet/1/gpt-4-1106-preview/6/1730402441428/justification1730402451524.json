  "justification": "The data clump with key 166 consists of fields that are common across TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto entities. These fields are `name`, `taskType`, `taskCode`, `taskDefinitionVersion`, `taskGroupPriority`, `firstSubmitTime`, `submitTime`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `host`, `executePath`, `logPath`, `retryTimes`, `pid`, `appLink`, `duration`, `maxRetryTimes`, `retryInterval`, `workerGroup`, `environmentCode`, `environmentConfig`, `executorId`, `varPool`, `executorName`, `delayTime`, `taskParams`, `dryRun`, `taskGroupId`, `cpuQuota`, `memoryMax`. This is a classic example of a data clump because these fields are used to describe the execution details of a task instance, and they are spread across multiple data transfer objects. The duplication of these fields can lead to inconsistencies and make the system more difficult to maintain. By encapsulating these fields into a single class, we can reduce duplication and improve code maintainability.",
