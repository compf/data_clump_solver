    "justification": "The data clump with key 197 is related to pagination, which includes the parameters 'loginUser', 'pageNo', 'pageSize', and optionally 'searchVal'. This clump occurs 40 times and affects 56 files, indicating a high level of duplication across the codebase. Many methods in different classes use these parameters to implement pagination, which is a common feature across various parts of an application. Refactoring this clump can drastically reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and provide a consistent pagination implementation throughout the application.",
