  "justification": "This data clump represents the pagination parameters (pageNo, pageSize, searchVal) which occurs 40 times across 56 files. Due to its high occurrence and wide impact across many files, it's likely to cause code duplication and make future changes more error-prone and harder to maintain. Refactoring this clump into a single Pagination object could greatly reduce duplication and centralize pagination logic.",
