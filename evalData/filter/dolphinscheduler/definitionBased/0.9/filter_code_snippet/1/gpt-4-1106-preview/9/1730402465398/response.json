    "justification": "The selected data clump is a group of fields that are duplicated in multiple classes (`TaskInstance` and `TaskInstanceExecuteDto`). These fields represent common attributes of a task instance within the system and are an integral part of the domain model. By refactoring these fields into a separate class, we can reduce duplication, make the classes cleaner, and establish a single source of truth for the representation of a task instance's data structure. Additionally, this change would affect multiple files, improving maintainability and coherence across the system.",
