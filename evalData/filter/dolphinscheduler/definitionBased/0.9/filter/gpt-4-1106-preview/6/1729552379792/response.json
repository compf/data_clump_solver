    "key": "166",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified with key 166 involves numerous fields across two different classes (TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto) suggesting repeated use of the same data structure. This repetition implies that a change to the TaskInstance's data would require corresponding changes in TaskInstanceExecuteDto, leading to maintenance challenges. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would centralize the common data structure, reducing the likelihood of errors and making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.",
