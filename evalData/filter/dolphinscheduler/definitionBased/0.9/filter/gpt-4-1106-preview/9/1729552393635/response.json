    "justification": "The TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto classes have multiple fields in common, which likely means there is a significant amount of code being used to map between these two data structures across the different layers (DAO, DTO, etc.). This affects maintainability and could lead to errors if changes are made. Refactoring this clump could centralize the data structure, making the codebase more robust and easier to understand.",
