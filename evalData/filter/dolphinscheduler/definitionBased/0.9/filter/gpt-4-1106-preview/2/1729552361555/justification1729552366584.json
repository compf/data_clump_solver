  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 occurs in two very pivotal layers of the application: the controller and the service layer. Since the parameters 'pageNo', 'searchVal', and 'pageSize' are commonly used across multiple methods for pagination and searching, addressing this data clump will not only improve code maintainability but also standardize pagination handling across different parts of the system. Refactoring this clump into a single PaginationFilter or SearchCriteria object that can be passed around would make the codebase cleaner, more consistent, and easier to understand when it comes to manipulating lists of data.",
