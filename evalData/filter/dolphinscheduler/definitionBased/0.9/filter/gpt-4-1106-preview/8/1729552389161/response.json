    "justification":"The data clump with key 166 has both a relatively high number of common fields (20) and affects multiple files (TaskInstance.java and TaskInstanceExecuteDto.java). This suggests that these files have a high degree of code duplication, potentially indicating that the TaskInstance data structure is repeated across different layers of the application, leading to maintenance challenges and a risk of inconsistencies. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate the TaskInstance data into a shared class that can be used in both files, which would simplify the codebase and reduce the risk of errors.",
