    "justification":"The data clump between 'TaskInstance' and 'TaskInstanceExecuteDto' classes contains several fields such as 'logPath', 'environmentConfig', 'taskParams', etc., that are part of the same domain context, which is task execution data. These fields are highly related and represent data that is likely to be processed together. Refactoring this data clump by extracting these fields into a new class will improve cohesion, make the code more readable, maintainable, and facilitate reuse of the task execution data structure across different parts of the application.",
