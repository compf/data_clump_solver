    "justification": "The data clump between the 'TaskInstance' class and 'TaskInstanceExecuteDto' class is most likely to affect the system's code maintainability negatively, as it involves a large number of common fields. These fields are related to the execution details of a task instance, and thus are central to business operations. Refactoring to remove this data clump would simplify the codebase, reduce duplication, and potentially decrease the likelihood of future bugs and inconsistencies in these critical areas when changes are made.",
