    "justification": "The data clump detected in the parameters of the 'queryAccessTokenList' method in both 'AccessTokenController' and 'AccessTokenService' indicates that the same grouping of parameters (pageNo, searchVal, pageSize) is used across different layers (controller and service). This repetition suggests that these parameters are used together often throughout the application, leading to duplicated code. By extracting these parameters into a single request object, we can reduce the duplication and make the method signatures cleaner, improving maintainability and reducing the likelihood of errors if the group of parameters needs to be changed or expanded in the future.",
