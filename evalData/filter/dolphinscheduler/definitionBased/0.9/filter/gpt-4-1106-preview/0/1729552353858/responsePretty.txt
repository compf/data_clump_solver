    "justification": "The data clump with key 197 represents method parameters that are used across two different classes (AccessTokenController and AccessTokenService) in the same method 'queryAccessTokenList'. The common parameters 'pageNo', 'pageSize', and 'searchVal' suggest a pattern of pagination that is likely to be a repetitive structure across multiple services and controllers, indicating that refactoring into a shared object could reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
