    "justification": "The data clump with key 166 consists of multiple fields that are shared between the 'TaskInstance' class and the 'TaskInstanceExecuteDto' class. These fields represent the core attributes of a task instance in the system, and thus they share a common domain related to task execution details. Refactoring this data clump by extracting these fields into a separate class would encapsulate the task instance's execution context, making the code more maintainable and reducing the risk of inconsistencies between the two classes. This would also simplify the codebase by reducing duplication and making it easier to understand the task-related data flow within the system.",
