    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 197 is found in the parameters of two methods (queryAccessTokenList in AccessTokenController and AccessTokenService). This clump occurs in the interaction between the controller and service layers, which is a common pattern in the application. Refactoring this clump can lead to a more maintainable and readable code as it reduces duplication across these layers and improves consistency in method signatures.",
