    "justification":"The data clump identified between the TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto classes suggests that these two classes share a significant number of common fields related to task execution details. This indicates that there is a domain concept of a 'TaskInstance' that is not currently encapsulated in a single class or structure. Refactoring these common fields into a new class would improve the domain model by making it more explicit, and it would reduce duplication between the two classes. This change could also simplify the codebase, as operations on task instances would be centralized in this new class.",
