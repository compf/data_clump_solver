  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it represents a common set of parameters used across different methods for querying access token lists. This repetition indicates that the same set of data is being used in multiple places, which can lead to duplication of code and potential inconsistencies if changes are made. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate these parameters into a single object, which can then be passed around, thus reducing duplication and improving maintainability.",
