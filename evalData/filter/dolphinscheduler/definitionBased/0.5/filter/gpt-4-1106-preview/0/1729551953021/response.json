    "justification":"The clump identified by key 166 involves a large number of common fields between two classes in different parts of the system (DAO and Extract layers), suggesting that these classes have a high degree of duplication regarding task instance data. This duplication can lead to inconsistencies and extra maintenance effort when changes are required, as they need to be applied in multiple places. Refactoring this clump into a shared class or structure could greatly reduce the risk of inconsistencies and simplify the codebase.",
