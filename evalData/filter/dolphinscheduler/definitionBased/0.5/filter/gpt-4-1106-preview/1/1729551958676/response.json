    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it represents a common set of parameters ('pageNo', 'searchVal', 'pageSize') that are used across different methods in different classes (AccessTokenController and AccessTokenService). This repeated group of parameters suggests that these methods are performing similar types of operations, likely related to pagination and searching, which is a common pattern in web applications. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate the pagination and search logic into a single class or structure, improving code maintainability and reducing the risk of inconsistencies in the handling of these operations across different parts of the application.",
