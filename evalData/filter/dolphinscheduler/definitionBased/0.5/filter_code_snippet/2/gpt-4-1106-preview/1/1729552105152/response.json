    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 consists of parameters related to pagination (loginUser, searchVal, pageNo, pageSize) which occur very frequently (40 times) across a significant number of files (56 files). This indicates a high level of duplication in the codebase, which can be simplified by encapsulating these parameters into a single PaginationRequest object. By doing this, the code will be cleaner, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors when pagination is implemented or modified across different parts of the application.",
