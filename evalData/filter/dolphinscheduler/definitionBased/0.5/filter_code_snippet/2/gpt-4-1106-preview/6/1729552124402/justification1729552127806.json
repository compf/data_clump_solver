  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 has a high occurrence across multiple files (40 occurrences affecting 56 files), which indicates extensive duplication and a strong case for refactoring. By extracting these parameters into a separate class, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and simplify method signatures. Moreover, this will make future changes to this set of parameters easier to manage and less error-prone.",
