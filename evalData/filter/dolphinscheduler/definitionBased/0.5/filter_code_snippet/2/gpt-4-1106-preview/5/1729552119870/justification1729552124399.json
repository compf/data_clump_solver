  "key": "197",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it occurs very often (40 times) and leads to much duplication across 56 affected files. This high occurrence indicates that there is a common pattern of parameters (loginUser, searchVal, pageNo, pageSize) being passed around in methods related to access token pagination, which suggests that these parameters are conceptually related and could benefit from being encapsulated into a single object. Refactoring this data clump can significantly reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
