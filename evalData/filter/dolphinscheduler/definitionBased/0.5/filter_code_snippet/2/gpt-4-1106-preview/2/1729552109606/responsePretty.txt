    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 197 occurs 40 times and affects 56 files, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across a wide range of files. This repetition could lead to higher maintenance costs and increased risk of bugs due to the need to update the same piece of logic in many places. Refactoring this data clump into a single method or class could greatly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase.",
