    "reason":"occurrence",
    "justification":"The data clump with key 166 occurs repeatedly across multiple classes and DTOs, indicating a high level of duplication of the task instance fields. This suggests that these fields are closely related and are likely to change together, making them a prime candidate for refactoring into a single class to represent the task instance concept. Extracting these fields into a class would reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and clarify the domain model.",
