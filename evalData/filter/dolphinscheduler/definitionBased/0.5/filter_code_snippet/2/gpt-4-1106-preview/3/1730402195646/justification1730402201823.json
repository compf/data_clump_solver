  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is present in multiple classes (TaskInstance.java and TaskInstanceExecuteDto.java) and contains a significant number of fields that are common across these classes. This repetition suggests a high level of duplication, which can lead to maintenance issues, make the code harder to understand, and increase the risk of errors if changes need to be made. By refactoring these common fields into a separate class, we can reduce duplication, improve code clarity, and make future changes easier to manage.",
