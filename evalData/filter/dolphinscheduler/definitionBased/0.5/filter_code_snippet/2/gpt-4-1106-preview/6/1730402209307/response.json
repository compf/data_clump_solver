    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 is a set of fields related to task instances. These fields are repeated across the TaskInstance entity class and the TaskInstanceExecuteDto class, which indicates a high level of duplication. Refactoring these fields into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the common properties of task instances.",
