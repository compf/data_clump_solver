  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 involves multiple fields that are common across different classes (`TaskInstance` and `TaskInstanceExecuteDto`). These fields represent the state and configuration of a task instance within the system, and the duplication suggests that they are a core part of the domain model. Refactoring this data clump would likely reduce duplication and improve maintainability across multiple files, as any changes to the task instance's representation would only need to be made in one place.",
