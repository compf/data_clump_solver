    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 166 is found in multiple classes (`TaskInstance` and `TaskInstanceExecuteDto`) and represents common fields related to task instance details. This clump occurs in both entity and DTO classes, which suggests that these fields are commonly used together and passed around in the codebase. Refactoring this clump into a single class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
