    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 consists of many fields that are common across the TaskInstance, TaskInstanceExecuteDto, and TaskInstance.java classes. This clump affects multiple files and classes, leading to duplication of field declarations and potentially increasing the risk of errors when changes are made. By refactoring this data clump, we could encapsulate these fields into a single class, thereby improving maintainability and reducing the likelihood of inconsistencies across different parts of the codebase.",
