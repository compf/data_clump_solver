    "justification": "This data clump was chosen because it occurs very often (40 times) and leads to much duplication across a large number of files (56 files), indicating that it is a common pattern that could greatly benefit from refactoring. By extracting this data clump into a separate class or method, we can reduce the duplication of the 'pageNo', 'pageSize', and 'searchVal' parameters, which are likely related to pagination functionality in the application. This will make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.",
