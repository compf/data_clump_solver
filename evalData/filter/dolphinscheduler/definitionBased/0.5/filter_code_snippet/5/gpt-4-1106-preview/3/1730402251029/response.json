    "justification": "The class 'TaskInstance' and 'TaskInstanceExecuteDto' and the fields within them are duplicated across multiple classes, indicating that they are used frequently in different contexts. This repetition of field declarations across classes suggests that a common structure is being used in various places, which could lead to unnecessary code duplication and potential inconsistencies if changes are made.",
