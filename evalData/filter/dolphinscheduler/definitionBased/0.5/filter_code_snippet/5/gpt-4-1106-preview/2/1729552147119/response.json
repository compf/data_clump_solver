    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen based on its high occurrence, which leads to much duplication. The common parameters 'User loginUser, String searchVal, Integer pageNo, Integer pageSize' are used in multiple methods across different files, which indicates that these parameters are a core part of the pagination functionality and are being repeated often. Refactoring this data clump can significantly reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the pagination logic.",
