    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 occurs across multiple classes (TaskInstance, TaskInstanceExecuteDto) and represents a significant duplication of fields related to task instance information. This clump is a prime candidate for refactoring because it represents a core domain concept in the application that is repeated in several places, which can lead to maintenance issues and makes the codebase harder to understand. By extracting these fields into a single class, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make the system easier to maintain.",
