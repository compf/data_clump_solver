    "justification": "This data clump is chosen because it occurs very often, leading to much duplication across multiple files. The repetitive use of 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' across different methods and services indicates a pattern that is used for pagination and searching functionalities. Refactoring this data clump into a single object would reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.",
