  "key": "197",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is the most critical to refactor due to its high occurrence across 56 affected files, with 40 occurrences of the same set of parameters. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication that could benefit from refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce the risk of errors when changes are made to the parameter list. By addressing this data clump, we can significantly simplify the codebase and make it more manageable.",
