    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 166 is found in multiple classes (TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto) and includes a significant number of fields that are common between these classes. This repetition suggests that these fields are related and represent a concept in the domain that could be encapsulated in a separate class. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code by centralizing the shared structure and behavior.",
