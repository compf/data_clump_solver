  "key": "197",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 197 is chosen because it occurs very often, leading to much duplication across 56 affected files with 40 occurrences. This indicates that the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' are commonly used together throughout the codebase, which could benefit significantly from refactoring to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
