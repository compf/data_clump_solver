    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which means it leads to a lot of duplication across the codebase. It appears in 56 affected files and occurs 40 times, indicating that it is a common pattern that may benefit significantly from refactoring. By addressing this data clump, we can reduce the duplication and potentially simplify the method signatures or class structures where it is used.",
