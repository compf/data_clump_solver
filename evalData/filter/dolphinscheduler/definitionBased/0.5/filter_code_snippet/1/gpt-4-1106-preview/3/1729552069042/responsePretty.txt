    "justification": "The data clump with key 197 is chosen because it affects 56 files, which indicates that a large part of the codebase could be simplified by addressing this clump. By refactoring this clump, we would potentially reduce duplication across many files, making the codebase easier to maintain and understand. The parameters involved are related to pagination, which is a cross-cutting concern that could be encapsulated into a reusable component or service.",
