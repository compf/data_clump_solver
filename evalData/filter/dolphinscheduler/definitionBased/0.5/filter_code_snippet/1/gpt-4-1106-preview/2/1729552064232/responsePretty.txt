    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence across the codebase. It is found in 56 affected files and occurs 40 times, which indicates a significant amount of duplication and potential for errors. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce the duplication of the 'loginUser', 'pageNo', 'searchVal', and 'pageSize' parameters across multiple methods and improve the maintainability of the code. Extracting these parameters into a separate class can also simplify method signatures and make the code more readable.",
