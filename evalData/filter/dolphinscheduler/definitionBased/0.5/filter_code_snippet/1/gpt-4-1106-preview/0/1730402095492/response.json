    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 represents a large set of fields that are common between two different classes: TaskInstance.java and TaskInstanceExecuteDto.java. This clump occurs in both classes and represents the properties of a task instance, which is a central concept in the system. Refactoring this clump into a separate class would reduce duplication, ensure consistency, and improve maintainability. It would also simplify the modification of the task instance properties in the future, as changes would only need to be made in one place.",
