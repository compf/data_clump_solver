    "justification": "The fields in TaskInstance.java and TaskInstanceExecuteDto.java classes represent the same concept in the domain of task execution, which includes task metadata, execution details, and environment configurations. These classes have at least 18 fields in common, indicating that they are closely related and represent a significant domain concept that would benefit from being encapsulated in a single class. Refactoring these data clumps into a shared class would improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and make the domain model clearer.",
