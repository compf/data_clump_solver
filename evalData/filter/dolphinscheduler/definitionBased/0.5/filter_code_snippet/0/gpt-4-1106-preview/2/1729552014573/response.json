    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 197 is chosen due to its high occurrence, which leads to a significant amount of duplication across 56 affected files and 40 occurrences. This implies that the 'pageNo', 'pageSize', and 'searchVal' parameters are frequently used together throughout the codebase, which suggests a strong case for refactoring to reduce duplication and potentially simplify method signatures.",
