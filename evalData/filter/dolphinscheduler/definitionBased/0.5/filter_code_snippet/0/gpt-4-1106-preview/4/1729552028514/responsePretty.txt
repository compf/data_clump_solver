    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it occurs very often, with 40 occurrences leading to significant duplication across 56 affected files. This indicates that the set of parameters 'User loginUser, String searchVal, Integer pageNo, Integer pageSize' is commonly used throughout the system, and refactoring it into a single class would reduce duplication and improve code maintainability.",
