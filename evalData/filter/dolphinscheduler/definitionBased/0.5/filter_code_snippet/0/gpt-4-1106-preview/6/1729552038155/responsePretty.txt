    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 is a set of parameters (User loginUser, String searchVal, Integer pageNo, Integer pageSize) that are used across 56 different files with a high occurrence of 40 times. This indicates a significant amount of code duplication and a high potential for bugs and maintenance issues. Refactoring this data clump into a single object would greatly reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase.",
