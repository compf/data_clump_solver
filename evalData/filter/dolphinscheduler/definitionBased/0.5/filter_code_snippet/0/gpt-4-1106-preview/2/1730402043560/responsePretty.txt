    "justification": "The data clump with key 166 represents a collection of fields that are common across two different classes (TaskInstance and TaskInstanceExecuteDto). These fields are related to task execution details, which indicates a high level of duplication. This clump occurs in multiple classes, suggesting that these fields are a fundamental part of the domain and are used frequently throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication, improve code maintainability, and enhance the domain model by encapsulating task execution details in a single, cohesive structure.",
