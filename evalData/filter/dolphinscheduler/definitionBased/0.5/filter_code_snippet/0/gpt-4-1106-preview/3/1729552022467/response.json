    "key": "197",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 has a high occurrence count of 40, indicating a significant amount of duplication across 56 affected files. This repetition suggests that the parameters 'User loginUser', 'String searchVal', 'Integer pageNo', and 'Integer pageSize' are frequently used together in the context of pagination and search functionality throughout the application. Refactoring this data clump into a single object would not only reduce duplication and improve maintainability but also simplify the method signatures and make it easier to extend pagination features in the future.",
