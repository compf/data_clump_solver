    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 166 represents a significant number of fields that are common across the TaskInstance entity class and TaskInstanceExecuteDto. This repeated group of fields indicates a high level of duplication, which can lead to maintenance issues and increased risk of bugs when these fields need to be updated or modified. By refactoring this data clump into a shared class or structure, the codebase can be made more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), improving maintainability and reducing the potential for errors.",
