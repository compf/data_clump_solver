    "justification": "This data clump is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, leading to significant duplication. Refactoring this clump would likely result in a more maintainable and less error-prone codebase by reducing the number of places where changes need to be made. Additionally, it would simplify method signatures and potentially improve the cohesion of the involved classes.",
