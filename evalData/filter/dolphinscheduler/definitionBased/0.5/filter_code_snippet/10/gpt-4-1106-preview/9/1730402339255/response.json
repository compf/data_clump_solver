    "key": "166",
    "reason": "affected_files",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 166 involves multiple fields that are common across the `TaskInstance` class and the `TaskInstanceExecuteDto` class. This indicates a high degree of duplication between these two classes, which can lead to maintenance challenges and increased risk of bugs when changes are made. Refactoring this data clump would improve code quality by reducing duplication and making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.",
