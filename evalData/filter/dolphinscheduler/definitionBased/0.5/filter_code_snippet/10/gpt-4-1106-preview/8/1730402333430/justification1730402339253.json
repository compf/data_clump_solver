  "key": "197",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 consists of the parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize', which appear in both the AccessTokenController and AccessTokenService methods for querying access tokens. This clump is chosen due to its frequent occurrence across the controller-service boundary, leading to duplicated code for handling pagination and searching. Refactoring this clump into a separate class would centralize pagination and search logic, thus improving maintainability and reducing the risk of inconsistencies.",
