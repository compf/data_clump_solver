    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 197 is chosen because it occurs in multiple places, leading to duplication of the parameters 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize'. This is seen across the AccessTokenController and AccessTokenService, indicating that these parameters are frequently used together when dealing with access token-related operations. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code.",
