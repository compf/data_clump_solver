    "justification":"The data clump consisting of 'id', 'createTime', and 'updateTime' is chosen due to its high occurrence across different classes and services. These fields are commonly used for tracking entity creation and modification times and are likely to be duplicated across various data models and DTOs. Refactoring these fields into a base class or a common structure would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
