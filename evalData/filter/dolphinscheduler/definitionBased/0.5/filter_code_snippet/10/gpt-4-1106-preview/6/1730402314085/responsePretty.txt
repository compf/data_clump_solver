    "justification": "The data clump consisting of fields related to task instances (id, name, taskType, processInstanceId, taskCode, taskDefinitionVersion, processInstanceName, taskGroupPriority, state, firstSubmitTime, submitTime, startTime, endTime, host, executePath, logPath, retryTimes, alertFlag, pid, appLink, flag, duration, maxRetryTimes, retryInterval, taskInstancePriority, processInstancePriority, workerGroup, environmentCode, environmentConfig, executorId, varPool, executorName, delayTime, taskParams, dryRun, taskGroupId, cpuQuota, memoryMax, taskExecuteType) is present across multiple files, affecting the 'TaskInstance' class and the 'TaskInstanceExecuteDto' class. This indicates that these classes are tightly coupled with the same data structure, suggesting that this data clump is significant and should be refactored to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
