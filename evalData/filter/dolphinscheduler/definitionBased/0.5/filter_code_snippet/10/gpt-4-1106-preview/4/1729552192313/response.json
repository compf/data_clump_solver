    "justification": "This data clump is chosen due to its high occurrence across many files, leading to widespread duplication and increased maintenance overhead. The parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' are common in pagination-related methods, which are a fundamental aspect of the web application's UI for listing various entities. Refactoring this data clump into a single PaginationRequest object would simplify method signatures and make the code more readable and maintainable.",
