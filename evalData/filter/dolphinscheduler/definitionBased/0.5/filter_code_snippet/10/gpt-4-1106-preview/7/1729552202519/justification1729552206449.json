  "key": "197",
  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 197 involves parameters 'loginUser', 'searchVal', 'pageNo', and 'pageSize' that are common across multiple methods and affect a large number of files (56 files) and occur very frequently (40 occurrences). This suggests that a significant part of the codebase could be simplified by refactoring this data clump, which would likely improve maintainability and reduce the potential for errors when these methods are used or modified.",
