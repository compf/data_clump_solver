    "justification":"The UsersServiceImpl class contains several methods with at least three common fields: User, String, and Map<String, Object>. These fields are related to user management operations, indicating a common domain of user-related functionality. Extracting these fields into a separate UserManagement domain class could encapsulate user-related operations, improve code readability and maintainability, and reduce the risk of errors when dealing with user data across different methods.",
