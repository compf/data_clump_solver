    "justification": "The 'UsersServiceImpl' class contains several fields that are related to the concept of a user and their associated entities (e.g., tokens, tenants, projects). These fields are used throughout various methods to handle operations related to user management. Extracting these fields into a separate 'UserContext' or similar class could encapsulate the user-related data more cohesively, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.",
