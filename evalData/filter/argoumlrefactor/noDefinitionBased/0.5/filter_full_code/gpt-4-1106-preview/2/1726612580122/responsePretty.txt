    "justification":"The data clump identified consists of a set of fields and methods related to color and font customization for a UI theme. This data clump is significant because it affects multiple files, indicating that the theme is likely used across different parts of the application. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate the theme-related properties and methods into a single class, improving maintainability and reducing duplication. This will also make it easier to add new themes or modify existing ones in the future."
