    "justification":"This class contains the data clump 'x', 'y', 'w' and 'h' which are used to represent the positions and dimensions of the life line. These variables are used together in multiple places such as in the 'setBoundsImpl' method. Extracting these variables into a class such as 'Rectangle' or 'Dimension' would improve the code quality by reducing the data clump and improving readability and maintainability."
