reason:"
size
",
justification:"
The class TreeModelSupport is large and contains multiple methods for managing tree model events. Refactoring it to extract smaller, cohesive classes can improve maintainability and readability. For example, separate classes for handling specific types of events (e.g., node insertion, removal, structure change) could be created, each with its own focused responsibility.
