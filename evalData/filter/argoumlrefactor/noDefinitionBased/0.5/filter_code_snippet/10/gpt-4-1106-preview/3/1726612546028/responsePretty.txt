    "justification":"The data clump associated with the key '58' has a high occurrence count of 434, which indicates a significant amount of duplication throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would greatly reduce redundancy and improve maintainability, as it affects a substantial number of files (41). By introducing a new method or object to encapsulate the common parameters (x, y, w, h), the code would become cleaner and any future changes to this logic would only need to be made in one place."
