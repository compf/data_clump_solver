{
    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump associated with the key '58' has a significantly high occurrence count of 434, which indicates that the same set of parameters is being used repeatedly across the codebase. This repetition suggests a high level of code duplication, which can lead to maintenance issues, make the code harder to understand, and increase the likelihood of bugs when changes are made. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure would greatly reduce duplication and improve the overall quality and maintainability of the code."
