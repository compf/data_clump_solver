    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high number of occurrences (434) across a significant number of affected files (41). This indicates that the clump is not only common but also widely spread across the codebase, which can lead to a high degree of code duplication and maintenance challenges. Refactoring this data clump would likely have a substantial impact on the code quality and reduce the potential for errors when changes are made to the related parameters."
