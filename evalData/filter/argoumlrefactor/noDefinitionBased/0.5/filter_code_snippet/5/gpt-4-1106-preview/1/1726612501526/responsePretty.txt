    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is chosen due to its extremely high occurrence, appearing 434 times across 41 files. This indicates a widespread pattern that, if refactored, could significantly reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and potentially decrease the risk of bugs due to inconsistent changes across such a large number of occurrences."
