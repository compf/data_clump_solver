    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has a relatively low size (4 parameters), but its high occurrence (434 times) across a large number of files (41 files) indicates that it is a common pattern in the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely reduce a significant amount of duplication and could potentially simplify the maintenance of those 41 files by introducing a new method or class that encapsulates these parameters."
