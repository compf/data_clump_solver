  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a relatively small size (4 parameters/fields), but it occurs an overwhelming number of times (434 occurrences) and affects a significant number of files (41 files). This high frequency of duplication across many files suggests that the codebase could greatly benefit from refactoring this data clump to reduce redundancy, improve maintainability, and possibly reduce the likelihood of errors when making changes to the related code."
