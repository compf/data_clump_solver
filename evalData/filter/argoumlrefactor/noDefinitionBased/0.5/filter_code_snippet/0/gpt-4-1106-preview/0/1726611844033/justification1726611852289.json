  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is chosen due to its high occurrence of 434 times across 41 affected files. This indicates that this particular set of parameters is reused extensively throughout the codebase, leading to significant duplication. Refactoring this data clump will not only improve code readability and maintainability but also reduce the risk of inconsistencies and errors in parameter usage. By introducing a new class or method that encapsulates these parameters, we can greatly simplify the code and make future changes easier to implement."
