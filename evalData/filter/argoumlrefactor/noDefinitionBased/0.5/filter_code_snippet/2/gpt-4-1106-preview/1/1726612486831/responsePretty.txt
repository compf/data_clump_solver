The data clump identified by key 58 has a relatively low size of 4 parameters, but its high occurrence of 434 times across 41 affected files suggests that it is a widespread pattern in the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a significant reduction of code duplication and improve maintainability across numerous files.
