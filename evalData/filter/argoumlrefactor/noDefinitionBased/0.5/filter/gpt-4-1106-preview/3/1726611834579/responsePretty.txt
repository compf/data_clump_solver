The selected data clump includes several FontUIResource and ColorUIResource objects that are closely related to theming and appearance settings in a user interface context. Extracting these into a separate class would encapsulate the theme-related properties, improving code readability, maintainability, and making it easier to manage theme changes. Since they share a common domain of UI theming, it makes sense to group them together, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and making the codebase more modular.
