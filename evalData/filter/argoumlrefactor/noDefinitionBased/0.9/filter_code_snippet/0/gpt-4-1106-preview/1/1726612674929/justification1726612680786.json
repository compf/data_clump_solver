  "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has an extremely high occurrence rate (434 times) indicating a significant amount of duplication and thus a strong candidate for refactoring. By abstracting this data clump, we can greatly reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. The affected files metric is also considerably higher (41 files) than others, but the occurrence rate is the most striking figure here."
