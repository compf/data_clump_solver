    "justification": "Although the data clump in key 58 has a size of 4, which is not the largest size among the provided clumps, it stands out due to its high occurrence of 434 times across a large number of affected files (41). This indicates that the clump is a common pattern in the codebase and addressing it would likely have a significant impact on the maintainability and readability of the code. Refactoring this clump could prevent future errors, reduce duplication, and simplify updates or changes to this pattern in the system."
