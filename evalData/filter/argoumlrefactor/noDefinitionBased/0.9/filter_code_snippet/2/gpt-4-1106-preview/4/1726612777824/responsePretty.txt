    "justification":"The selected data clump has a smaller size (4 parameters/fields) compared to others, but it has the highest occurrence (434 occurrences) as well as affecting a significant number of files (41 files). Such a high occurrence suggests a pattern that is heavily used and duplicated across the codebase, increasing the potential for errors, making the code harder to maintain, and likely indicating a strong case for abstraction to improve code reusability and clarity."
