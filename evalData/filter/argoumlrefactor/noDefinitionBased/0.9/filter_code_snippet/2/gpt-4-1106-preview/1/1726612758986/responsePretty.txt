The chosen data clump identified by key 58 has a very high occurrence (434 times) and affects a significant number of files (41 files). Although its size is not the largest, the high number of repeat occurrences suggests that this is a pervasive pattern in the codebase which may be resulting in a lot of duplicated code. Refactoring this data clump should therefore be a priority to reduce maintenance overhead and improve code clarity by encapsulating the common pattern, likely into a method or a utility class. The fact that it is repeated across many files also increases the risk of inconsistent changes and bugs. Thus, addressing this clump offers a substantial benefit to the code quality.
