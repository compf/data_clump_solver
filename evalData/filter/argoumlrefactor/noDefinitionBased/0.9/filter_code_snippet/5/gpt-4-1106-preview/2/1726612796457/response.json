    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58, concerning coordinate properties (x, y, w, h), has a high occurrence, appearing a total of 434 times across 41 affected files. This indicates substantial duplication of code that involves setting or handling the position and dimensions of figures within diagrams. Refactoring this clump would therefore eliminate a significant amount of duplication, likely making the code more maintainable and enabling potential future modifications or extensions related to figure positioning and dimension handling to be made with greater ease and less risk of errors or inconsistencies."
