    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is the most significant concern because it has the highest occurrence count (434 occurrences), indicating extensive duplication of this set of parameters throughout the project. Such repetition not only bloats the codebase but also signifies a higher risk for errors during future changes, as any modifications would need to be consistently applied across all instances. Reducing this duplication by encapsulating the clump into an object could significantly improve the maintainability and readability of the code."
