While other data clumps might have a high size or impact a decent number of files, the data clump with key 58 is chosen for its extremely high occurrence across many files. With 434 occurrences in 41 files, this data clump represents a pattern that is repeated very often and is spread throughout a significant portion of the codebase. Refactoring this data clump could substantially reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
