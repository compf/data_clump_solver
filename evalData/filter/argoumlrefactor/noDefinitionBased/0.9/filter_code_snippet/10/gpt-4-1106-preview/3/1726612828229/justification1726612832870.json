  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The selected data clump, represented by the key 58, has a very high occurrence count of 434, which indicates that this particular group of parameters is repeated across the codebase extensively. Reducing this duplication will lead to significantly less repetitive code, easier maintenance, and the potential for fewer bugs if the implementation needs to be updated or fixed. This clump also affects a large number of files (41), which means that its impact on the codebase is widespread, and addressing it could improve readability and consistency across multiple components of the project."
