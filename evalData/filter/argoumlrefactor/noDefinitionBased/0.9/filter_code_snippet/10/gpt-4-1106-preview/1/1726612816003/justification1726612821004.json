  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump associated with the key 58 has a much higher occurrence than any other data clump, appearing 434 times across 41 files. This implies that the chosen data clump represents a pattern that is frequently repeated throughout the codebase, leading to significant duplication and potential inconsistencies. Refactoring this clump would greatly reduce code duplication, simplify future changes (as updating the clump in one place would propagate throughout the codebase), and likely improve maintainability. This could lead to a more robust and easier to understand codebase. Although the size of this clump is not the largest, the sheer number of occurrences justifies prioritizing its refactoring."
