  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has an extremely high occurrence (434 times) across many files (41 files), indicating that the set of parameters (x, y, w, h) is a common structure that is likely duplicated throughout many different parts of the codebase. Refactoring this clump into a single object representing a rectangle or dimension could greatly reduce code duplication and improve maintainability."
