  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The selected data clump has the highest occurrence value, which indicates it is repeated many times throughout the codebase. This leads to widespread code duplication, maintenance challenges, and increases the risk of inconsistent changes or errors in the future. Refactoring this clump into a single method or class should greatly improve code clarity and reduce future errors."
