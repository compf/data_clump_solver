justification:"
The data clump identified by key 58 stands out because of its exceptionally high occurrence count, which indicates a significant amount of code duplication across a large number of files. This redundancy can lead to errors and make the codebase harder to maintain. Refactoring this clump by possibly creating a method or a helper class to encapsulate the repeated use of x, y, w, h parameters would improve code readability and maintainability.
