    "justification":"The data clump with key '58' is chosen due to its extremely high number of occurrences (434) across a significant number of files (41). This indicates that this particular combination of parameters represents a common concept or structure that is repeatedly used throughout the affected files. By refactoring this data clump into a single class or method, we can dramatically reduce the duplication, make the code more maintainable, improve readability, and reduce the potential for errors if changes to the clump are required in future development."
