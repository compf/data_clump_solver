The data clumps found in JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme classes are highly cohesive and represent attributes related to the theme's appearance (fonts and colors), which is a clear domain in UI design. Extracting this information into a separate Theme or Style class could encapsulate theme-related properties and behavior, improving maintainability and providing a central place to modify the theme's appearance.
