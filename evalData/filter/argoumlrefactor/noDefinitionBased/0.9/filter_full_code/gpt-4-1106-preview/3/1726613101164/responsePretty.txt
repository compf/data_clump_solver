The data clump contains 15 UIResource objects and 5 fields. These all seem to be related to UI theme settings, and it would make sense to encapsulate them into a single class, such as 'ThemeResources' or similar. This would make the code more organized, easier to maintain and extend, and improve readability by grouping related variables. Furthermore, having a class to represent a theme would make it more convenient to switch between themes or add new ones.
