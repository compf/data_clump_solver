The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence of 434 times across 41 affected files. This indicates a widespread pattern that, if refactored, could significantly reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. By extracting this data clump into a separate method or class, we can encapsulate the repeated logic and make the codebase more modular and easier to understand.
