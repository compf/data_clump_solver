    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has the highest occurrence count of 434, which indicates that it is repeated across the codebase very frequently. This repetition suggests that there is a significant amount of duplication that could be reduced by refactoring. Although the size of the data clump is not the largest, the high frequency of occurrence means that addressing this clump could lead to a substantial improvement in code maintainability and reduce the potential for errors when making changes to the related code."
