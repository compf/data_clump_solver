    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has a significantly higher occurrence (434 times) compared to the others, which suggests that it is a common pattern that is repeated throughout a large number of files (41 files). Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a substantial reduction in code duplication and improve maintainability."
