    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence of 434 times across 41 affected files. This suggests that the clump is a common pattern in the codebase and its refactoring could lead to a significant reduction in code duplication and complexity. By extracting this clump into a separate method or class, we can improve the maintainability and readability of the code."
