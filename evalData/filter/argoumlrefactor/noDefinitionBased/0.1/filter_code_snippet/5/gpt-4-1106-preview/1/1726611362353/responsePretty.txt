    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence count of 434, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a substantial reduction in code duplication, improving maintainability and potentially reducing the risk of errors when changes are made to the related code. Although the size of the data clump is not the largest, the high frequency of occurrence suggests that it is a common pattern that could benefit from being abstracted into a more reusable and maintainable structure."
