    "justification": "The data clump consisting of the ColorUIResource fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 is present in both JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme classes. This indicates that the color scheme is a significant aspect of the theme and is duplicated across multiple files. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the color scheme definition.",
