  "justification": "The classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' both contain fields representing primary and secondary colors, as well as fonts, which are part of the same domain of UI theming. These fields are used to define the look and feel of the UI, and thus they share a common domain. Extracting these fields into a separate class would encapsulate the theme-related properties and methods, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.",
