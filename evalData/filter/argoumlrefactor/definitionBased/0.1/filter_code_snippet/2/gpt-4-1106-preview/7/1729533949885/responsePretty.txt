    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 affects a significant number of files (41), which implies that the duplication is widespread across the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a more maintainable and cleaner code structure, as it would reduce the duplication across many different parts of the system. By introducing a new class or structure to encapsulate the common parameters (x, y, w, h), we can simplify method signatures and make the code more readable and easier to change.",
