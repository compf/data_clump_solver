    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is chosen because it affects a significant number of files (41), which implies that refactoring this clump would potentially reduce duplication across a large portion of the codebase. This could lead to easier maintenance and less error-prone code when dealing with the parameters involved in the creation of figures in the diagram classes.",
