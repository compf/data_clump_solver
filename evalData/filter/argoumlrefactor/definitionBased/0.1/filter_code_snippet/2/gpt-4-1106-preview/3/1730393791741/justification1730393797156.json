  "justification": "The data clump consists of the color resource fields 'primary1', 'primary2', 'primary3', 'secondary1', 'secondary2', and 'secondary3' which are common between the classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme'. This clump affects multiple files and indicates a strong theme-related concept that is duplicated across different theme classes. Refactoring this clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability when themes are modified or new ones are added.",
