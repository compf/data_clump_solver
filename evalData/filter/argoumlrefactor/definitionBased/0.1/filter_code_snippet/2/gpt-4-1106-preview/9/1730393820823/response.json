    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 is present in two different classes (JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme) which suggests that multiple files are affected by this data clump. The fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 are common in both classes, indicating a strong case for creating a separate class to encapsulate these related properties. This would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.",
