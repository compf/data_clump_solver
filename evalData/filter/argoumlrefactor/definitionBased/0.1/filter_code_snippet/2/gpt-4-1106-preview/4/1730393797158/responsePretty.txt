    "justification":"The classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' both define a set of ColorUIResource objects for primary and secondary colors, which are related to the domain of UI theming. These fields represent a common concept of color theming and are likely to be used together, making them a strong candidate for extraction into a separate class. This would encapsulate the theme colors in one place, promoting reusability and reducing duplication.",
