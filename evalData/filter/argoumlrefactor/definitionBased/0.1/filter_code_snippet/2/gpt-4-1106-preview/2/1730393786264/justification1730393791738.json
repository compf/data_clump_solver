  "justification": "The classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' both define a set of ColorUIResource and FontUIResource objects that represent theme colors and fonts. These fields are related to the visual theme of the user interface, which is a specific domain. Extracting these fields into a separate 'Theme' class would encapsulate the theme-related properties and methods, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. It would also facilitate the creation of new themes by extending the 'Theme' class.",
