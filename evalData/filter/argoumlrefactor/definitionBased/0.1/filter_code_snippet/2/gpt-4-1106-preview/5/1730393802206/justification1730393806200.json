  "justification": "The data clump consists of the color and font properties that are common between two different theme classes, JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme. This indicates that the theme-related properties are duplicated across multiple files, which can lead to inconsistencies and make the code harder to maintain. By extracting these properties into a separate class, we can reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the theme-related code.",
