  "key": "58",
  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is chosen because it affects a significant number of files (41), which implies that the duplication is widespread across the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely have a substantial impact on the maintainability of the code by reducing duplication and potentially simplifying the interfaces between these files. This could lead to easier changes in the future and less chance for bugs when the same logic is implemented in multiple places."
