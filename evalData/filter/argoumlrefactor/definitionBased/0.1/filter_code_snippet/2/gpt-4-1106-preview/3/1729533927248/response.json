    "key": "58",
    "reason": "affected_files",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is chosen because it affects a significant number of files (41), which implies that any changes to the parameters or the method signature would require updates across many parts of the codebase. This can lead to a high risk of introducing bugs and makes the code harder to maintain. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate the parameters into a single object, reducing the impact on multiple files and improving the maintainability of the code.",
