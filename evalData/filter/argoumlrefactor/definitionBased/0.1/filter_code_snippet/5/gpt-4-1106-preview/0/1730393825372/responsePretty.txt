    "justification": "The data clump consisting of the ColorUIResource fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, secondary3, and the FontUIResource fields controlFont, systemFont, windowTitleFont, userFont, smallFont are duplicated across two different files: JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that these fields are part of a common theme structure and are likely to be used in similar ways across different theme classes. By refactoring this data clump into a separate class, we can reduce duplication and improve maintainability. Any changes to the theme structure would only need to be made in one place, rather than in every theme class.",
