    "justification": "The classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' both define a set of ColorUIResource and FontUIResource objects that represent a theme. These fields share a common domain related to UI theming, which suggests that they could be encapsulated into a separate 'Theme' class. This would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by allowing theme-related properties to be managed in a single place.",
