  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 is present in two different classes: 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme'. Both classes have the same set of ColorUIResource fields with identical initialization values. This suggests that these fields are part of a common theme configuration and are duplicated across multiple theme classes. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and make it easier to manage theme configurations across different classes.",
