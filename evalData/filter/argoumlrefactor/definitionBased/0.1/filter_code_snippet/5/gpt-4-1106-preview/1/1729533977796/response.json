    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 21 times across 41 affected files. This suggests that the parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h' are commonly used together throughout a significant portion of the codebase, leading to widespread duplication. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would greatly reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.",
