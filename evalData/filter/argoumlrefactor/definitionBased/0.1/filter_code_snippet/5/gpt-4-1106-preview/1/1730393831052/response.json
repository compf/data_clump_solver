    "justification": "The classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' both contain fields that represent UI resources such as colors and fonts. These fields are related to the visual theme of the user interface, which is a specific domain. Extracting these fields into a separate 'Theme' class would encapsulate the theme-related properties and methods, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. It would also facilitate the creation of new themes by extending the 'Theme' class.",
