  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 affects a significant number of files (41), which implies that the duplication is widespread across the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a substantial reduction in code duplication and improve maintainability. By introducing a new class or structure to encapsulate the common parameters (x, y, w, h), we can simplify method signatures and make the code more readable. Additionally, this change could facilitate future modifications to the related functionality, as updates would be centralized in the new class rather than scattered across numerous files."
