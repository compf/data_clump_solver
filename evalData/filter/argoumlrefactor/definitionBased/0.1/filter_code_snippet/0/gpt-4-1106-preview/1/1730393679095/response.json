    "justification": "The fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java represent a set of colors that are likely to be part of a common theme or color scheme domain. These fields are duplicated across two classes, suggesting that they are part of a larger concept related to UI theming. By extracting these fields into a separate class, we can encapsulate the theme-related properties and reduce duplication. This would also make the code more maintainable and extendable, for example, if we want to add more themes or modify existing ones.",
