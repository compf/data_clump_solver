    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has the highest occurrence count of 434, which indicates that it is a pattern repeated across many instances. This high frequency of repetition suggests that refactoring this data clump could lead to significant improvements in code maintainability and reduce the potential for errors. By addressing this data clump, we can encapsulate the common parameters into a single object, thereby simplifying method signatures and making the codebase more coherent and easier to understand."
