    "justification": "The data clump consisting of the ColorUIResource fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 is present in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that the color scheme is a significant aspect of the theme and is duplicated across multiple theme files. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and make the codebase more maintainable by centralizing the color scheme definition.",
