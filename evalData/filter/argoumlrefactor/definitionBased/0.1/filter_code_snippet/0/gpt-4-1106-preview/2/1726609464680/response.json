    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has the highest occurrence count (434), indicating that it is a pattern that is repeated very frequently across the codebase. This suggests that there is a significant amount of duplication that could be reduced by refactoring this data clump. By addressing this clump, we could potentially simplify the code, reduce errors, and make future changes easier to implement. The affected files count is also high (41), which further supports the need for refactoring to improve maintainability across multiple files."
