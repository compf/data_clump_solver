    "justification": "The data clump consisting of the ColorUIResource fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 is present in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that the color theme is a common concept across multiple theme files and suggests that these fields are part of a larger theme-related domain that could be encapsulated in its own class. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication across theme files and centralize theme-related properties, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend with new themes.",
