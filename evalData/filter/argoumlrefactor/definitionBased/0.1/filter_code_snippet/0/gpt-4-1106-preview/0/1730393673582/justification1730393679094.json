  "justification": "The fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 in both JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme classes represent a set of colors that are related to a common theme. These fields are a clear example of a data clump that share a common domain, which is the color scheme of a UI theme. Refactoring these fields into a separate class would encapsulate the theme colors, making the code more modular and easier to manage. It would also facilitate changes to the color scheme and improve the readability of the code.",
