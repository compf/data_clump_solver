    "justification": "The data clump consisting of the ColorUIResource fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 is present in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that the color theme is a common concept across multiple theme files, which suggests that these fields are part of a larger theme-related domain that could be abstracted into its own class. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication across theme files and centralize the theme color management, making it easier to maintain and extend.",
