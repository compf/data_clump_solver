    "justification": "The data clump consisting of the ColorUIResource fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 is present in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that there is a common theme-related concept that is duplicated across multiple files. Refactoring this data clump would help in centralizing the theme color definitions, making it easier to manage and maintain the theme colors across different theme classes.",
