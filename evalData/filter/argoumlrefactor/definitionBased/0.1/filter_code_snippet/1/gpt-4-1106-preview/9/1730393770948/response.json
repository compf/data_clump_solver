    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 is present in both 'JasonsBigTheme.java' and 'JasonsHugeTheme.java'. This indicates that the color and font resources are duplicated across multiple theme files, which affects maintainability and consistency. By extracting these resources into a separate class, any changes to the themes' color schemes or fonts would only need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and making the codebase easier to manage.",
