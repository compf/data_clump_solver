  "justification": "The data clump consisting of the ColorUIResource fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, secondary3 is present in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that the color scheme is a significant aspect of the theme and is duplicated across multiple theme files. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and make the theme colors easier to manage and modify.",
