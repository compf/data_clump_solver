    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 21 times across 41 affected files. This suggests that the parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h' are commonly used together and are likely to represent a rectangle or position and size of a graphical element. Refactoring this data clump into a single object would significantly reduce duplication and improve code maintainability.",
