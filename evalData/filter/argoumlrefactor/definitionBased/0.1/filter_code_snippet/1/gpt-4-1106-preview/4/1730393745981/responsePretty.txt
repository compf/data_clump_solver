    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 is present in two different theme classes (JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java) and consists of six common fields related to UI resources (three ColorUIResource fields for primary colors and three for secondary colors). This clump affects multiple files and indicates a common theme structure that could be abstracted into a separate class. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce duplication and make the theme-related code more maintainable and extensible.",
