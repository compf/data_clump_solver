  "justification": "The data clump consisting of the color resource fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 is present in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that the color scheme is a significant aspect of the theme and is duplicated across multiple theme files. By extracting these fields into a separate class, we can reduce duplication and make the color scheme easier to manage and reuse across different themes.",
