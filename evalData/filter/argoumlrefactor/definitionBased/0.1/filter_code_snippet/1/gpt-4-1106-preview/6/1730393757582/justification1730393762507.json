  "justification": "The data clump consisting of the color and font properties is present in both 'JasonsBigTheme.java' and 'JasonsHugeTheme.java'. This indicates that the theme-related properties are duplicated across multiple theme classes, which affects maintainability and consistency. By extracting these properties into a separate class, any changes to the theme's color or font settings would only need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and making the codebase easier to manage.",
