    "justification":"The data clump consisting of the color UI resource fields (primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, secondary3) is present in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that the theme-related color settings are duplicated across multiple theme files, which affects maintainability and consistency. If the color settings need to be changed, they must be updated in multiple places. By extracting these fields into a separate class, any changes to the theme's color settings would only need to be made in one place, improving the maintainability of the code.",
