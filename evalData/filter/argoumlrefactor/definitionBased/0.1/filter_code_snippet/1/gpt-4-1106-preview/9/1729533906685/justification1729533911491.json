  "justification": "This data clump is chosen because it affects a significant number of files (41), which implies that refactoring it would potentially reduce complexity and improve maintainability across a large portion of the codebase. By extracting the common parameters into a class, we can encapsulate the related data and operations, leading to cleaner and more modular code.",
