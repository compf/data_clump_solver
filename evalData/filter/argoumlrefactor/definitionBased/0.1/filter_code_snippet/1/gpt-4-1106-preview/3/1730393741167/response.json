    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 is present in both 'JasonsBigTheme.java' and 'JasonsHugeTheme.java', indicating that the color and font resources are duplicated across multiple theme files. This duplication suggests that these resources are part of a common theme structure and could be better managed by extracting them into a separate class. By doing so, any changes to the theme's colors or fonts would only need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and simplifying maintenance.",
