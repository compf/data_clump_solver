    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 involves the parameters (x, y, w, h) which are coordinates and dimensions. This clump is found in methods across different files, indicating that multiple parts of the system are dealing with graphical elements in a similar way. Refactoring this clump could lead to a more centralized and consistent handling of graphical object dimensions and positioning, which would improve maintainability and reduce the risk of errors when changes are made to the graphical representation.",
