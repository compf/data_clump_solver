    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 involves the parameters (final int x, final int y, final int w, final int h) which are used in methods across different files (FigLifeLine.java and FigBaseNode.java). This indicates that the same concept of defining a rectangle or bounds is being repeated across multiple classes, which affects maintainability and consistency. By refactoring this data clump, we can ensure that changes to the concept of a rectangle or bounds are made in a single place, improving the design and reducing the risk of errors.",
