  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 involves the parameters (x, y, w, h) which are coordinates and dimensions. This clump is found in methods across two different files, indicating that multiple parts of the system are affected by this same set of data. Refactoring this clump into a single object would improve the codebase by centralizing the concept of a rectangle or bounding box, which is a common graphical concept.",
