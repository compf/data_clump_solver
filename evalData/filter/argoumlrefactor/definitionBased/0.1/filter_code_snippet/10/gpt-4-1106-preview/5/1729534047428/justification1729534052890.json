  "key": "58",

  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 is chosen due to its high occurrence across a significant number of files (41 affected files with 21 occurrences). This suggests that the parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h' are commonly used together in various methods related to setting bounds or creating figures, which indicates a strong case for encapsulation. By refactoring this data clump, we can reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make future changes to the related functionality easier to manage.",
