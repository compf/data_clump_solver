    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 represents a set of parameters (x, y, w, h) that are used to define the position and size of graphical elements in two different classes (FigLifeLine and FigBaseNode). This clump occurs in multiple methods across these classes, indicating a common concept that could be encapsulated in its own class. Refactoring this data clump would reduce duplication and improve the code's maintainability by centralizing the logic related to positioning and sizing of figures.",
