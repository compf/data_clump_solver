    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 represents a common set of parameters (x, y, w, h) that are used to define the bounds or size of graphical elements in different methods across multiple classes. This clump occurs frequently as it is a fundamental aspect of defining the visual representation of elements in a diagram. By refactoring this data clump into a single class, we can encapsulate the concept of a 'rectangle' or 'bounds' and reduce duplication across the codebase. This will make the code more maintainable and easier to understand, as the operations related to bounds will be centralized in one place.",
