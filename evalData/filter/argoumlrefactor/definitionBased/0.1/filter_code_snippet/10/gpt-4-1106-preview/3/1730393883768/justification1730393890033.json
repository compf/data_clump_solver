  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 involves the parameters (x, y, w, h) which are coordinates and dimensions used in methods related to graphical elements in different classes. This clump affects multiple files, indicating that the same concept of positioning and sizing graphical elements is being replicated across various parts of the application. Refactoring this clump would likely improve the maintainability of the code by centralizing the concept of a rectangle or bounding box into a single class.",
