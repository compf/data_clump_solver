    "justification":"The classes JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme both define a set of UI resources such as colors and fonts that are used to style the user interface. These resources are related and share a common domain, making them suitable candidates for extraction into a separate class. Similarly, the classes CoreFactory and CoreFactoryMDRImpl both define methods for creating UML model elements, which are also related and share a common domain of model element creation. Refactoring these data clumps into separate classes would improve cohesion and reduce duplication.",
