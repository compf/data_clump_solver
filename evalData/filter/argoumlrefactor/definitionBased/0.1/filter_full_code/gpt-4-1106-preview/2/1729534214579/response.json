    "justification":"The classes JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme both define a set of color and font properties that are related to the theme of the user interface. These properties share a common domain and represent the look and feel of the UI components. Similarly, the classes CoreFactory and CoreFactoryMDRImpl contain methods that create instances of UML model elements, which also share a common domain of model element creation. Extracting these properties and methods into separate classes would improve cohesion and make the code more maintainable by encapsulating related functionalities.",
