These fields are highly cohesive and represent a distinct concept within the domain of UI theming. Extracting these fields into a separate class would encapsulate the theme-related properties, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. It would also facilitate potential reuse of the theme settings across different parts of the application or in different applications altogether.",
