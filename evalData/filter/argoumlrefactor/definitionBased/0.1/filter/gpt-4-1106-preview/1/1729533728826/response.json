    "justification": "The data clump between 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' classes involves multiple fields related to UI resources such as fonts and colors. These fields represent a clear domain of theme settings and are likely to be used together to define the appearance of the UI. Extracting these fields into a separate 'Theme' class would encapsulate the theme-related properties and methods, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. It would also facilitate reuse of theme settings across different parts of the application and potentially simplify the process of adding new themes or customizing existing ones.",
