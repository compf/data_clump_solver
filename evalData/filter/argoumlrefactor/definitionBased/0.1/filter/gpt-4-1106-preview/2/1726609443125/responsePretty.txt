    "justification": "The data clump between 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' classes involves multiple fields related to UI resources such as fonts and colors. These fields are highly cohesive and represent a specific domain of UI theming. Extracting these fields into a separate class, such as 'ThemeResources', would encapsulate the theme-related properties and methods, promoting reusability and reducing duplication across different theme classes. This refactoring would also simplify the theme classes and make them more maintainable."
