justification:"
Both 'JasonsBigTheme.java' and 'JasonsHugeTheme.java' contain a significant number of common fields (11 fields are identical between the two classes). The similarity in naming convention ('Big' vs 'Huge') suggests these classes are variations of a theme. Extracting these common fields into a separate class would reduce duplication and make future maintenance and changes easier to manage across theme variations.
