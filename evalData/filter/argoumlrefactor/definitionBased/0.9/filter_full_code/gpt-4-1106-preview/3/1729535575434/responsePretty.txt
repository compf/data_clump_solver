    "justification":"The provided key represents a data clump because it contains a set of parameters (MClassifierRole, MMessage, MComment) that are repeatedly used together in multiple locations within the codebase. These parameters are related to the mapping between UML objects and their corresponding Fig representations in a collaboration diagram. Refactoring this data clump into a single object would simplify the code, improve readability, and reduce the likelihood of errors if changes need to be made to the mappings in the future.",
