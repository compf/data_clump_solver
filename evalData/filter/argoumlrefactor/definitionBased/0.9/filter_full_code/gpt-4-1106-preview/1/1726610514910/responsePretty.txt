justification:"
The data clump identified in the JasonsHugeTheme class affects multiple files. Both 'JasonsBigTheme.java' and 'JasonsHugeTheme.java' contain the common fields 'primary1', 'primary2', 'primary3', 'secondary1', 'secondary2', 'secondary3', 'controlFont', 'systemFont', 'windowTitleFont', 'userFont', and 'smallFont', which indicates a high degree of code duplication across files. This duplication suggests that the themes are varying only in terms of font size and similar attributes, which can be parameterized or abstracted into a common superclass or utility class to promote reusability and reduce code duplication.
