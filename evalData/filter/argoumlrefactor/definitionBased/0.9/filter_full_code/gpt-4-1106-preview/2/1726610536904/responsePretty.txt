The method `fireTreeStructureChanged` in the class `TreeModelSupport` is used to notify JTree components about structural changes in the underlying tree model. The presence of this method in many files indicates that `TreeModelSupport` class is being used across multiple areas for UI tree component updates, thereby affecting several parts of the application UI that deal with JTree views and rendering. Any changes to this class or method could potentially impact various JTree displays in the application, making it an important aspect of the UI update mechanism.
