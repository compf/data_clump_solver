    "justification": "The selected data clump occurs very frequently across multiple files (e.g., 'JasonsBigTheme', 'JasonsHugeTheme' contain repetitive color and font resources; 'CoreFactory' contains repeated methods for creating UML elements). Refactoring these clumps can help reduce code duplication, ease maintenance, and improve code readability.",
