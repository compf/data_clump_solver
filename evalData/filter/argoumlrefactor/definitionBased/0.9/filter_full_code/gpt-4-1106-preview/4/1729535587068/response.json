    "justification": "These fields represent a common theme, and extracting them into a class can encapsulate the theme-related information together. They form a distinct concept within the domain of UI theming, making it clear that these colors are related and should be managed together. By extracting these fields into a separate class, we can improve cohesion within the 'JasonsHugeTheme' class by removing the direct responsibility for managing theme colors and enhance reusability since the new class can be used by other themes or parts of the application that might need to access these specific colors.",
