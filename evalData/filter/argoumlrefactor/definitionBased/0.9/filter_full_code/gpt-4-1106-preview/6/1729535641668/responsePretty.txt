    "justification": "The ClassifierRole is a core concept in UML. It is used to specify a role that instances can play within an interaction. The data clump contains three fields representing primary1, primary2, and primary3, which are colors used to visualize a ClassifierRole in the UI. These colors are specific to the domain of the UML specification and represent a common theme that should be encapsulated in a separate class. This not only reduces duplication but also improves the readability and maintainability of the code by isolating domain-specific visual properties into a dedicated class.",
