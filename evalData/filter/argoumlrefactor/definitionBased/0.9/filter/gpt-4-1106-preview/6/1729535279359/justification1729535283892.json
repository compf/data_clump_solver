  "justification": "The data clump between 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' classes involves a significant number of UI resource fields which are related to styling and theming of a user interface. Given that both classes deal with themes, it's indicative of a common domain around UI appearance which can be abstractly defined as a 'Theme' or 'Style'. Extracting these fields into a separate class would encapsulate all theme-related properties and provide a more cohesive and reusable abstraction.",
