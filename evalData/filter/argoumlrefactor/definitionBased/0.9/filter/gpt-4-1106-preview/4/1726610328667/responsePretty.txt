    "justification": "The fields `controlFont`, `userFont`, `windowTitleFont`, `smallFont`, `systemFont`, and associated `ColorUIResource` fields in `JasonsBigTheme` and `JasonsHugeTheme` classes point to the notion of UI theming, which is a clear domain concern. These classes have identical sets of private final fields related to font and color resources, indicating a strong domain concept that would benefit from being extracted into a separate `Theme` class or similar structure. This would centralize the theme-related properties and methods, and facilitate future theme modifications, ensure consistency, and reduce the duplication between these closely related classes. It also represents the most parameters/fields among the given data clumps, further justifying its significance."
