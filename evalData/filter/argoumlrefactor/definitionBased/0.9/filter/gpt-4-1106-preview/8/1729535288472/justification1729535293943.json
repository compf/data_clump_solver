  "justification": "The data clump between JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme classes consists of multiple FontUIResource and ColorUIResource fields, which all relate to theming and UI design. By grouping these related fields into a separate 'Theme' class, we can encapsulate the properties of a theme and promote better cohesion within our classes. Furthermore, the presence of identical fields in both classes suggests these classes could potentially extend a common parent class or interface that provides the theme settings, thus promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.",
