Extracting these into a single `Theme` class can encapsulate appearance-related properties and methods, leading to a more organized and maintainable codebase. It encapsulates a common theme concept, which seems to be spread over at least two classes ('JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme') and is therefore likely to be a meaningful domain concept.",
