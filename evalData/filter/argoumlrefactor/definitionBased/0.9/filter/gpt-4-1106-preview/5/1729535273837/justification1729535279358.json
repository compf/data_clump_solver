  "justification": "The data clump between 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' contains a large number of fields related to UI resources, such as fonts and colors. Given that both classes are theme-related and likely to be dealing with similar UI components, it seems sensible that these fields are part of a larger concept that pertains to theming. Since there are many fields involved, the complexity and maintenance of these resources can be significantly reduced by encapsulating them into a separate class. This will make the code more modular, reusable, and easier to understand.",
