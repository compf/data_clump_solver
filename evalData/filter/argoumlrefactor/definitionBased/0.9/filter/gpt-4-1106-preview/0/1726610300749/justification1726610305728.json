  "justification": "Data clump '0' involves a significant number of fields related to UI theming (fonts and colors) that are shared between two different theme classes. Given that UI themes are likely to be expanded or modified in the future, this duplication can lead to errors and inconsistency in the appearance of the application if changes are made to one theme and not the other. By refactoring these fields into a separate class or a hierarchy of theme classes, future changes to the theme can be made in one place, ensuring consistency across different themes and reducing the risk of errors."
