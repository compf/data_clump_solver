  "justification": "The clump from 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' includes multiple Font and Color resources that represent common traits of a User Interface theme. This suggests a domain-specific grouping that could be encapsulated into a 'Theme' or 'Style' class. This would simplify future theme management and ensure consistent style application across different themes. Additionally, having these resources grouped in a theme class would make it easier to add new themes or modify existing ones without the risk of missing related properties.",
