justification:"
The data clump with key 0 affects two files directly (JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java) and includes a large set of fields related to fonts and colors, which are fundamental for the themes' visual consistency. By refactoring these common fields into their own class (e.g., ThemeAppearance), it would reduce duplication and improve maintainability when modifying theme-related attributes. It also centralizes theme-appearance logic, making it easier to create and manage new themes.
