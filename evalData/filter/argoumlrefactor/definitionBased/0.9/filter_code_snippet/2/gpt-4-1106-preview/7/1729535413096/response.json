    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is present in a significant number of files (41 affected files), which likely indicates that many parts of the application would benefit from this refactoring. It suggests that the x, y, w, h (position and size) parameters are used across multiple diagram elements and are therefore a fundamental aspect of the application's design. Refactoring this data clump would lead to improved maintainability and reduced error potential.",
