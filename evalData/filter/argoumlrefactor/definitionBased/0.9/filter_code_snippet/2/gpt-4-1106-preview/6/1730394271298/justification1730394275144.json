  "justification": "The two classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' contain several fields representing UI resource elements such as colors and fonts, which share a common domain of UI theming. These fields are duplicated across the two theme classes, which suggests that they could be encapsulated into a separate 'Theme' class. By doing this, it would be easier to add new themes or modify existing ones without duplicating code. Additionally, it promotes better organization of UI-related properties and allows for consistent use of these properties across different themes.",
