    "justification":"The data clump with key 58 affects 41 files, which implicates a high impact on the codebase. Refactoring this would likely lead to a significant reduction in duplication across many parts of the application, leading to a cleaner, more maintainable codebase. Since both methods deal with UI components and their placement, encapsulating these parameters into a single object would make the code more readable and easier to manage.",
