    "justification":"The data clump with key 58 affects a significant number of files (41), which suggests that the parameters used within 'createActivationFig' and 'setBoundsImpl' methods are shared across many parts of the system. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would reduce coupling and duplication across a wide scope of the codebase, leading to easier maintenance and potential for reuse in different contexts.",
