justification:"
The data clump identified by key 58 shows a combination of parameters (x, y, w, h, ...) that occurs very often (434 occurrences) across a large number of files (41). This indicates a high level of replication and potential for errors. Refactoring this data clump into an object could greatly reduce the complexity of method signatures and increase code maintainability.
