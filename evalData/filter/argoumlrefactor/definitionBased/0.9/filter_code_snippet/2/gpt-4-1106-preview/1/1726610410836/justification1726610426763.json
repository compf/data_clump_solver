  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "This data clump is chosen because it occurs very often, with a total occurrence of 434 times across 41 affected files. This indicates a pattern that is frequently repeated and likely to cause significant code duplication, which can make the codebase harder to maintain and understand. Refactoring this data clump into a single method or an object could greatly reduce complexity and improve code quality."
