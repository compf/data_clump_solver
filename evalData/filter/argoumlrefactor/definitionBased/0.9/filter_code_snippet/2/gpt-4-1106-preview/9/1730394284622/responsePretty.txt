    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 involves color and font resources that are duplicated in two distinct theme classes ('JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme'). This data clump affects multiple files as it appears to be the basis of the theming system. Not only does this duplication make it harder to maintain consistent theming across the application, but it also increases the risk of inconsistencies and errors when new themes are added or existing themes are modified. By extracting this data clump into a separate 'ThemeResources' class, the system would benefit from centralized control of theme resources, making it easier to manage and maintain the styling of the application.",
