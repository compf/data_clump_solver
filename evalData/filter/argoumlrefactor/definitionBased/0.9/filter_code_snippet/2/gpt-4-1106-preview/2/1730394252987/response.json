    "justification": "The 'buildAssociationEnd' method with its parameters occurs in multiple files which shows duplication because the parameters are same and repeated in 'CoreFactory.java', 'CoreFactoryMDRImpl.java' and 'CoreFactoryEUMLImpl.java'. These parameters represent a single concept of building an 'AssociationEnd' which could be encapsulated into a single object to avoid duplication and improve code readability and maintenance.",
