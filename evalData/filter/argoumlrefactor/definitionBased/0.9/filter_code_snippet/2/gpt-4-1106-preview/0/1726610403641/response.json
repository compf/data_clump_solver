    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "Selected data clump key '58' because it occurs 434 times, which indicates a significant level of duplication across 41 affected files. Refactoring this data clump will likely improve maintainability by reducing the repeated use of the same set of parameters in 'createActivationFig' and 'setBoundsImpl' methods. Centralizing this clump into a single class or structure could simplify method signatures and enhance code clarity, potentially preventing errors and reducing the effort required for any future changes to the associated parameters."
