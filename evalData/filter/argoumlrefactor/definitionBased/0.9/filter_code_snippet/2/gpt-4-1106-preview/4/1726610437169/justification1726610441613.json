  "justification": "This data clump was selected due to its high occurrence, appearing 434 times, which indicates a significant duplication throughout the codebase. Refactoring this will dramatically reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. Moreover, consolidation of these fields can potentially improve performance by minimizing similar method calls and standardizing object creation patterns for diagram elements in 'FigLifeLine' and 'FigBaseNode'. These are likely critical classes for the rendering of diagrams, suggesting that changes here could have far-reaching positive impacts on the code quality and future feature development."
