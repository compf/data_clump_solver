    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58, which involves the parameters (x, y, w, h), seems to have a significant impact as it affects a large number of files (41 in total). This indicates that these parameters are likely reused across many parts of the codebase, potentially leading to high coupling and reduced maintainability. Refactoring this data clump could lead to a common abstraction that simplifies parameter management and improves code clarity.",
