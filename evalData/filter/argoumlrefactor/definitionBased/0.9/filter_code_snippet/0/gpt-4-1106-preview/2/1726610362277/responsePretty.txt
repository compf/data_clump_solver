    "key":"58",

    "justification":"The data clump associated with key 58 is chosen because it has the highest occurrence, appearing 434 times, which indicates significant code duplication and repetition across a large number of affected files. This repetition could lead to more complex maintenance and potential errors due to inconsistent changes across instances. Refactoring this data clump by, for example, introducing a value object or parameter object to encapsulate the common parameters (x, y, w, h) would greatly reduce duplication and improve the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase."
