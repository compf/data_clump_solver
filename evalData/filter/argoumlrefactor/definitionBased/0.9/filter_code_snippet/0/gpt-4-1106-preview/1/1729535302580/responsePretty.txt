    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 consists of four parameters (x, y, w, and h) which are found in two separate methods across multiple files (41 total files affected). The high number of occurrences (21 times) of this data clump indicates significant duplication that could be reduced by refactoring the code. By creating a single class that encapsulates these parameters, we can improve the maintainability and readability of our codebase, and reduce the likelihood of errors when making future changes.",
