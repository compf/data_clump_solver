    "justification":"The data clump linked to key 58 involves a method `createActivationFig` with parameters (owner, x, y, w, h, settings, messageFig) and another method `setBoundsImpl` with parameters (x, y, w, h). Although the number of common parameters is just on the threshold (4 in this case), the impact is significant due to the high number of affected files (41). This indicates that the duplication of these fields across multiple classes is likely resulting in a widespread maintenance issue, as any change to the meaning or handling of these parameters would require updates in many places. By refactoring these fields into a single shared concept, we can reduce this risk and improve the cohesion of the code.",
