    "justification": "The method 'buildAssociationEnd' with a significant number of parameters (10) is duplicated across multiple classes (CoreFactory.java and CoreFactoryMDRImpl.java), which implies that any change in the parameter list would need to be replicated across all instances of the method. This is error-prone and makes maintenance harder. Refactoring this data clump can reduce duplication and improve the design.",
