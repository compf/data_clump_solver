    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "I selected this data clump because it has an extremely high number of occurrences (434), which suggests there is significant code duplication associated with it across a large number of files (41 affected files). Refactoring this data clump to introduce a new concept (such as a 'Bounds' object for x, y, width, and height properties) would likely have a substantial impact on the codebase, reducing duplication and potentially making the related areas of the code more understandable and maintainable."
