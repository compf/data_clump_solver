The data clump identified by key '58' involves parameters used by methods responsible for creating and setting bounds of diagram elements. These methods are found in core diagram classes which are likely to be used extensively throughout the application, contributing to high occurrence of the data clump. This repetition not only hampers maintainability but also increases the risk of errors during future modifications. By refactoring this data clump, possibly into a unified structure like a 'Dimensions' or 'Position' object, it could simplify method signatures, make future changes less error-prone, and improve the overall design and readability of the codebase.
