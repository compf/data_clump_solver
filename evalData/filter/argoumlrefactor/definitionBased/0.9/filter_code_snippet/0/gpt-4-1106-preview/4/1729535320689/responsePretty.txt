    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 affects 41 files, which indicates that a large portion of the codebase relies on a consistent set of parameters (x, y, w, h). Refactoring this clump will have a significant impact on the code maintainability, and reduce the risk of errors across these numerous files. Consolidating these parameters into a single `Rectangle` or `Dimension` class would improve the clarity and reusability of the related methods, and encapsulate the concept of a shape or size more coherently.",
