  "justification": "The buildAssociationEnd method with a large number of parameters (assoc, name, type, multiplicity, stereo, navigable, order, aggregation, scope, changeable, visibility) is repeated across multiple classes (CoreFactory.java, CoreFactoryMDRImpl.java) and seems to be a central method in the system's model layer. Refactoring this data clump would reduce the duplication of these parameters across different parts of the codebase, make the code cleaner, easier to read, and maintain. Furthermore, by grouping these parameters into a single object, it would simplify method signatures and make future changes to this part of the model less error-prone.",
