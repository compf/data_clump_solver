  "justification": "The 'primary1', 'primary2', 'primary3', 'secondary1', 'secondary2', and 'secondary3' fields are common between 'JasonsBigTheme.java' and 'JasonsHugeTheme.java', indicating a clump that affects multiple theme files. These fields represent color themes and are part of the presentation layer. By refactoring, we can centralize theme management, which would simplify theme modifications and ensure consistency across different themes.",
