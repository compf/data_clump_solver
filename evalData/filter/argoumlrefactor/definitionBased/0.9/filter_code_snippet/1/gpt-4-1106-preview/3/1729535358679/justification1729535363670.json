  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a significant high number of occurrences (21), which suggests that it is a commonly repeated structure and represents a major source of duplication across a high number of affected files (41). By refactoring this data clump, we can drastically reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and make the codebase easier to work with. This pattern indicates a common task or concept that is central to the application and should therefore be abstracted into its own class or method to encapsulate its properties and behaviors more effectively.",
