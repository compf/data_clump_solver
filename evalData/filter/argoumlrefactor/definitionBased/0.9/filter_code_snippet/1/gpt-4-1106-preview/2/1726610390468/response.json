    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has the highest occurrence rate at 434 times, which suggests that it is a common pattern within a significant number of files (41 in total). Refactoring these instances could therefore result in a considerable reduction of code duplication and complexity across the affected classes. Creating a new class or structure to encapsulate these parameters would promote code reusability and make maintenance easier, due to the high frequency of this data clump appearing in the codebase."
