  "justification": "The size of the data clump is smaller than some others, with only 4 fields/parameters in common, but it is by far the most widespread one, affecting a total of 41 files and appearing 21 times across the codebase. This indicates that making changes or additions in the future would require alterations in numerous places, greatly increasing the risk of errors and inconsistencies. Refactoring this data clump would dramatically reduce this risk and simplify future maintenance.",
