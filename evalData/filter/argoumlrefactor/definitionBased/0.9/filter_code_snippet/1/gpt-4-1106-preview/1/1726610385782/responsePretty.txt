    "justification": "The data clump identified with key 58 has a high occurrence rate of 434, which suggests that refactoring this clump could significantly reduce code duplication. Additionally, with 41 affected files, it is apparent that multiple parts of the system are reliant on the same data structure, indicating that centralizing this structure would enhance maintainability. Although the size of the clump is not as large as others, the high occurrence and broad impact across numerous files make it a prime candidate for refactoring."
