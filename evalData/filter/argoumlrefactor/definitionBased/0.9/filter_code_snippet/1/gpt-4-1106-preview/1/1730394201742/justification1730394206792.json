  "justification": "The data clump in key 12 ('assoc', 'name', 'type', 'multiplicity', 'stereo', 'navigable', 'order', 'aggregation', 'scope', 'changeable', 'visibility') represents a method signature repeated in multiple class interfaces and an implementing class. Its frequent occurrence increases the risk of changes in one place requiring changes in all other places, which complicates maintenance and evolution of the code. Moreover, a high number of parameters in a method signature suggests that the method is doing too much or that there is a missing abstraction. In this case, encapsulating these parameters into a class could simplify the method signatures and promote code reuse.",
