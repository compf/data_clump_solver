    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "Data clump with key 58 has an occurrence count of 434, which indicates a high level of code duplication. This suggests the potential refactoring of the createActivationFig(...) and setBoundsImpl(...) methods would greatly improve the code maintainability, reducing the risk of errors and simplifying updates. Such a high frequency of duplication across a significant number of files (41) emphasizes the necessity of addressing this clump to enhance the code quality."
