    "justification":"The data clump with key 58 is most significant due to its extremely high occurrence across many files, leading to a substantial amount of duplication. With 434 occurrences affecting 41 files, this redundancy is likely to complicate maintenance significantly and increase the risk of bugs during changes. Refactoring this clump would greatly enhance code readability and maintainability."
