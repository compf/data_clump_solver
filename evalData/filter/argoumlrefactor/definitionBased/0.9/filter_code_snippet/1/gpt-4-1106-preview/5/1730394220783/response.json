    "justification":"The color resource fields 'primary1', 'primary2', 'primary3', 'secondary1', 'secondary2', and 'secondary3' are duplicated across JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that at least two different classes have at least three common fields, affecting multiple files. This duplication suggests that these themes share a common color configuration that could be centralized in a separate class to simplify theme management and any future updates to the color scheme.",
