  "justification": "The color and font UI resources declared in 'src/argouml-app/src/org/argouml/ui/JasonsBigTheme.java' and 'src/argouml-app/src/org/argouml/ui/JasonsHugeTheme.java' represent a significant data clump. Both classes share at least three common fields related to UI color and font resources, which indicates that these are theme-related settings that are used across different themes. By refactoring this data clump into a separate class, we can reduce duplication, making it easier to manage and apply consistent theme settings across different parts of the application. This will likely affect multiple files where theme settings are applied, leading to a more maintainable code base.",
