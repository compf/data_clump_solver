    "justification":"The data clump highlighted by key 79 involves a GraphModel, a Layer object, another object representing a node or edge, and a Map for styleAttributes. It appears twice in the CollabDiagramRenderer class, affecting both FigNode and FigEdge creation methods. This indicates the presence of a commonality in how figures are being rendered in collaboration diagrams. Having these parameters grouped together frequently suggests a possible refactor towards an object that encapsulates these rendering details, which can reduce the duplication and improve code maintainability across different files and types of figures (nodes and edges).",
