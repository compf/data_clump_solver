    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The chosen data clump is identified in the `FigLifeLine.createActivationFig` and `FigBaseNode.setBoundsImpl` methods, which share four common parameters (x, y, w, h). This clump has a notably high occurrence value of 434 occurrences and affects a large number of files (41), indicating that it leads to widespread duplication and suggesting that refactoring could significantly reduce redundancy. By addressing this data clump, we could streamline a substantial portion of the codebase, potentially improving its maintainability and reducing the risk of errors in parameter handling across many different areas of the project."
