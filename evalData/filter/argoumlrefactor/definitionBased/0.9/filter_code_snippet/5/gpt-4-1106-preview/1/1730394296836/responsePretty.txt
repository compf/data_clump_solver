    "reason": "domain",
    "justification": "The classes JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme have multiple common fields representing UI theme attributes. These attributes (colors and fonts) clearly belong to a common domain related to UI theming, and therefore creating a class such as 'UIThemeAttributes' encapsulates these properties in a domain-meaningful way, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.",
