    "justification": "The classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' both contain a series of ColorUIResource and FontUIResource fields that are related to theming. These fields fit within a specific domain of UI presentation, specifically relating to the appearance and theming of UI components. By refactoring these fields into a separate class, you could encapsulate the theming information, making it easier to manage and reuse across different themes or components.",
