    "justification": "The data clump identified consists of three common fields (primary1, primary2, primary3, and secondary1, secondary2, secondary3) prevalent in two different classes JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme. This clump significantly impacts the maintainability of these theme classes. If the color schemes were to change or be extended in the future, changes would have to be replicated across multiple classes. By refactoring these common fields into a shared class, we can eliminate the duplication and centralize color scheme management.",
