    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "Although there are data clumps with higher numbers of occurrences, I selected key 58 because it has the highest occurrence within a significant number of affected files (41), indicating a wide impact on the codebase. This suggests a high level of duplication and a lack of encapsulation across multiple diagrams in 'argouml-core-diagrams-sequence2' and 'argouml-core-diagrams-activity2'. Refactoring this data clump will likely improve maintainability and consistency across these diagrams' classes."
