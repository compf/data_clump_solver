  "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has a high number of occurrences (434) across a significant number of affected files (41), suggesting that it represents a common pattern of parameters that could benefit from refactoring into a single object. Eliminating this data clump would likely lead to a substantial reduction in code duplication and increase code maintainability."
