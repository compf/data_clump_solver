    "justification": "The classes JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme have multiple common fields related to UI theming, such as colors (primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, secondary3) and fonts (controlFont, systemFont, windowTitleFont, userFont, smallFont), which share a common domain of UI theme configuration. By extracting these fields into a separate class, we could encapsulate the theme-related properties, providing clarity and potentially easing the management and extension of theme configurations in the future.",
