    "justification": "This data clump has the broadest impact across the codebase, affecting a substantial number of files (41). The repetition of the parameters x, y, w, h across multiple methods indicates a common concept of rectangular dimensions or position that could be abstracted into a single object, reducing the complexity and improving maintainability across the numerous affected files.",
