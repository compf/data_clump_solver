    "justification":"I have chosen this data clump because it affects a significant number of files (41 files), which indicates that refactoring this data clump could lead to improvements in a substantial portion of the codebase. This widespread duplication suggests that many parts of the system may be handling similar concepts in a coordinated manner. By refactoring this clump, one could reduce the complexity of the code, enhance maintainability, and decrease the potential for errors when similar changes need to be applied across multiple files. Furthermore, the frequent occurrence (21 times) of this clump demonstrates that it's a recurring pattern that likely represents a concept in the domain that could benefit from being captured in its own class.",
