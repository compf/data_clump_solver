The chosen data clump for refactoring is identified by key 58, which is related to setting the bounds of figures in diagrams. The size of the data clump is not the largest among the provided options, but its occurrence is significant, appearing 434 times, suggesting it has a substantial impact on the codebase in terms of duplication and potential bugs. Moreover, a high number of affected files (41) indicates that this data clump is widespread throughout the application, and refactoring it would lead to more maintainable and reusable code. This data clump represents a strong candidate for creating a new class or a new method that encapsulates these common parameters (x, y, w, h), potentially improving the design and readability of the code.
