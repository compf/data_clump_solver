    "justification":"The data clump consisting of the methods isStereotype in ExtensionMechanismsHelper and AbstractExtensionMechanismsHelperDecorator is chosen due to its frequent occurrence. Since both methods share a common purpose and operate on similar arguments, refactoring these into a single representation reduces duplication and the risk of future inconsistencies. Additionally, the presence of a common domain among the arguments suggests that these methods can potentially benefit from a refactored representation that encapsulates the stereotype concept.",
