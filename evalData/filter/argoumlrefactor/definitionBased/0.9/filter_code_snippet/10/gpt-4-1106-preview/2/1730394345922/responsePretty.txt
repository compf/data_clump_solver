    "justification": "The data clump here includes the parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', 'h', which represent the coordinates and size of a graphical figure. These parameters are used across different methods in the 'FigLifeLine.java' and 'FigBaseNode.java' classes, indicating that there might be a common concept of positioning and sizing that applies to figures in this application domain. Given that this clump affects multiple files and likely represents a cross-cutting concern through the graphical parts of the system, it is a prime candidate for refactoring.",
