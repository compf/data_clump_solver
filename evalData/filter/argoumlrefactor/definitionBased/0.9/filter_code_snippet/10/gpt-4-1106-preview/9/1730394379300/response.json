    "justification": "The data clump consisting of parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h' appears as method parameters in multiple files and methods (FigLifeLine.java, FigBaseNode.java), which indicates that several different parts of the system are affected by this clump. Refactoring this clump would therefore improve maintainability and reduce the potential for errors across multiple files.",
