    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 88 is chosen due to its high occurrence in different methods within the same class. It leads to duplication as the same set of parameters (source, path, childIndices, children) are passed to multiple methods for tree node event handling. Refactoring this data clump will improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the risk of errors if there are changes to the parameters in the future.",
