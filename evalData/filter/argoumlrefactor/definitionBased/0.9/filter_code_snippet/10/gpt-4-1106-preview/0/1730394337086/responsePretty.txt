    "justification": "The classes JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme have multiple common fields such as primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, secondary3, controlFont, systemFont, windowTitleFont, userFont, and smallFont. These fields are related to theme settings such as colors and fonts and appear to be constants or configuration settings that are duplicated in each class. Refactoring these into a separate class would reduce the size of each class and consolidate theme settings into a single place for easier maintenance and potential expansion.",
