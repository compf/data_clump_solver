  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 is used in a very large number of files (41 files), which suggests that the code pertaining to the coordinates and dimensions (x, y, w, h) is widely reused across the system. Refactoring this clump could significantly reduce the duplication of these parameters and improve maintainability by centralizing the logic related to positioning and sizing components in the user interface.",
