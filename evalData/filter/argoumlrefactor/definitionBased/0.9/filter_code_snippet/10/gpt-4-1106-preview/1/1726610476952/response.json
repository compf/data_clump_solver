    "justification":"The data clump with the key '58' is chosen because it affects 41 files. This implies that a significant portion of the project has multiple instances where a method signature with a common set of parameters repeats. Refactoring this would likely reduce errors, improve maintainability, and simplify changes that affect all those methods. By creating a new class or structure to encapsulate the common parameters (x, y, w, h), the code would become more readable and easier to manage across such a large number of files."
