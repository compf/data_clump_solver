    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 involves method parameters that are repeated in multiple methods across a significant number of files (41 affected files). This suggests that this clump impacts a broad portion of the codebase, increasing the potential for code duplication and maintenance issues. Refactoring this data clump into a single class can greatly simplify the method signatures and improve code reuse. Additionally, the parameters (x, y, width, height) are related to defining bounds, which is a common operation across UI components, suggesting that this type of data deserves its own abstraction.",
