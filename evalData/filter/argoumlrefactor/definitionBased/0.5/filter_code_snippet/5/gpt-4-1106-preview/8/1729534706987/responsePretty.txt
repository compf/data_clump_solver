    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 affects a significant number of files (41), which indicates that a large part of the codebase could benefit from the refactoring. By introducing a class that encapsulates the common parameters (x, y, w, h), we can reduce duplication across these numerous files and improve maintainability. This change would likely have a widespread positive impact on the codebase.",
