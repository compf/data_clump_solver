    "justification": "The classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' both contain a large number of common fields related to UI resource definitions, such as colors and fonts. These fields represent a specific theme and are a clear example of a data clump. Refactoring this data clump would not only reduce duplication but also centralize theme management, making it easier to maintain and extend. By extracting these fields into a separate class, any changes to the theme would only need to be made in one place, and it would be straightforward to introduce new themes.",
