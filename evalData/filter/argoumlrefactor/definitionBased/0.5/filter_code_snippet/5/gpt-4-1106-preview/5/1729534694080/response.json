    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 is chosen because it affects a significant number of files (41), which implies that any change to the parameters of the methods would require changes across many files. This can lead to higher maintenance costs and a greater potential for introducing bugs. Refactoring this data clump into a single class would reduce duplication and simplify future changes.",
