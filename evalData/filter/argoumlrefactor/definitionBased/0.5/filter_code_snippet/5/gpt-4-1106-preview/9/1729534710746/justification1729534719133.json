  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 affects 41 files, which indicates a high level of duplication and potential for significant impact on the codebase if refactored. By addressing this data clump, we could reduce the complexity and improve the maintainability of a large number of files. This could lead to easier updates and modifications in the future, as well as a more unified way of handling the parameters involved.",
