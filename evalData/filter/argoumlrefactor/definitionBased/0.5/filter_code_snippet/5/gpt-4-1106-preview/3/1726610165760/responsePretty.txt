    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is selected due to its high occurrence across the codebase, appearing 434 times. This suggests that there is significant duplication and that refactoring this clump would likely result in a more maintainable and cleaner codebase. By addressing this clump, developers can reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies that may arise from having to update the same set of parameters in many places."
