  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a relatively smaller size (4 parameters/fields) compared to others, but it has a significantly higher impact in terms of the number of affected files (41 files). Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a more maintainable codebase as it would reduce duplication across a large number of files.",
