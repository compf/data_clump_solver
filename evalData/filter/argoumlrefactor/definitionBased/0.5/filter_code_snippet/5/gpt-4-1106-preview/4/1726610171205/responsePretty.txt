    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 is present in 41 different files, which suggests that a large portion of the codebase is affected by this duplication. Refactoring this data clump would likely have a significant impact on the maintainability of the code, as it would reduce redundancy and improve consistency across a wide range of components. By introducing a new class or method to encapsulate the common parameters (x, y, w, h), the code would become more modular, easier to understand, and less error-prone when changes are required."
