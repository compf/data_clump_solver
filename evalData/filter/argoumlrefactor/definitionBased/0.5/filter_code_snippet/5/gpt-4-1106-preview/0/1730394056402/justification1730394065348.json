  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 represents the same set of parameters (x, y, w, h) that are used across different methods in different classes (FigLifeLine and FigBaseNode). This suggests that these parameters are related to a common concept, likely the dimensions and position of a graphical figure in the user interface. Refactoring this data clump would improve code maintainability and reduce the chance of errors when these parameters are used across the system. Since the parameters are used in methods of classes that are part of the user interface, it is likely that changes to one may affect the others, indicating a high impact on multiple files.",
