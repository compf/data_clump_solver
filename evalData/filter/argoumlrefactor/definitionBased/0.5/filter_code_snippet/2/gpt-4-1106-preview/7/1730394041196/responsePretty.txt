    "justification": "The classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' have common fields that are related to UI theming, such as primary colors, secondary colors, and fonts. These fields are part of the same domain, which is the visual theme configuration. By extracting these fields into a separate class, we can encapsulate the theme-related properties and methods, making the code more modular and easier to manage. The new class could then be used to configure different themes without duplicating these fields across multiple classes.",
