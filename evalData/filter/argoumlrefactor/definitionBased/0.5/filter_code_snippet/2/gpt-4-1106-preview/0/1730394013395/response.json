    "justification":"The classes 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' both define a set of ColorUIResource and FontUIResource fields that represent theme properties. These fields share a common domain related to UI theming, which suggests that they could be encapsulated into a separate 'ThemeProperties' class. This would reduce duplication and improve the design by allowing theme properties to be managed in a single place, promoting reuse and easier maintenance.",
