    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 affects a significant number of files (41 in total), which implies that a large portion of the codebase is impacted by this duplication. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a substantial reduction of code duplication across multiple files, improving maintainability and potentially reducing the likelihood of bugs related to the repeated code structure. By extracting a class to encapsulate the common parameters, the code would become cleaner, and any future changes to this logic would only need to be made in one place.",
