  "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is chosen because it affects a significantly high number of files (41), which suggests that refactoring this data clump would potentially reduce duplication and improve maintainability across a large portion of the codebase. By extracting a class from this data clump, we could encapsulate the common parameters and reduce the complexity of method signatures in these numerous files.",
