    "justification":"The data clump with key 58 is chosen because it affects a large number of files (41), which indicates that refactoring this data clump would potentially reduce complexity and improve maintainability across a significant portion of the codebase. By addressing this data clump, we can encapsulate the x, y, w, and h parameters into a single object, likely a 'Rectangle' or 'Bounds' class, which would simplify method signatures and make the code more readable.",
