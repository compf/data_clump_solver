    "justification":"The data clump consisting of the ColorUIResource fields for primary and secondary colors appears in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates a common theme-related data structure that is replicated across multiple theme files, which suggests that it is a core part of the theme's data representation. By refactoring this data clump into a separate class, we can reduce duplication across theme files and make the theme system more maintainable and extensible.",
