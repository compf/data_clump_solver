    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is chosen because it has the highest occurrence value (434), indicating that it is duplicated across a very large number of places. This suggests that there is significant code duplication, which could lead to maintenance issues and make the codebase harder to understand and modify. Refactoring this data clump would likely have a substantial impact on reducing redundancy and improving the overall quality of the code."
