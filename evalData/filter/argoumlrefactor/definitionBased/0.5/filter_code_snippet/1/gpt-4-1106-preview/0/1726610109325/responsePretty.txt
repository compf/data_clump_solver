justification:"
The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence count, appearing 434 times across 41 files. This suggests significant code duplication and a high impact on code maintenance. Refactoring this data clump could greatly reduce code complexity and improve readability by encapsulating the common parameters into a single object or structure. This would also make future changes to this set of parameters easier to manage and less error-prone.
