  "justification": "The data clump consists of three ColorUIResource fields (primary1, primary2, primary3) and three more ColorUIResource fields (secondary1, secondary2, secondary3), which are repeated across two different files (JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java). This indicates a common theme-related concept that is duplicated. Refactoring these into a separate class can reduce the duplication and make the theme management more maintainable. Moreover, changes to the theme colors would only need to be made in one place.",
