  "justification": "The data clump consisting of the color UI resources primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 appears in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that the color scheme is a significant aspect of the theme and is duplicated across multiple theme files. Refactoring this would reduce duplication and centralize the color scheme definition, making it easier to manage and update the themes consistently.",
