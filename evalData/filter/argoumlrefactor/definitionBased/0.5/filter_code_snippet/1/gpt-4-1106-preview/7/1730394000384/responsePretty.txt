    "justification":"The color and font properties are duplicated across two different theme classes, which indicates that these properties are part of a common theme structure. By refactoring these properties into a separate class, we can reduce duplication and make the themes easier to maintain. Changes to the common properties would only need to be made in one place, rather than in every theme class that uses them. This can improve the codebase's maintainability significantly, especially if more themes are added in the future or if the existing themes are frequently modified.",
