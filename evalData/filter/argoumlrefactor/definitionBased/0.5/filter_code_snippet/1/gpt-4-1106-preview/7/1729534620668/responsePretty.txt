    "justification":"The data clump with key 58 has the highest occurrence with a total of 21 times, which suggests that the same set of parameters is being passed around in many places. This high frequency of repetition indicates that there's a significant amount of duplication, which could be reduced by refactoring. By extracting these parameters into a single class, the code would become more maintainable, and any changes to this group of data would only need to be made in one place.",
