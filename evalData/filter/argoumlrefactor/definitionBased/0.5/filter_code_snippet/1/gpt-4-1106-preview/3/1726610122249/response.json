    "justification": "The chosen data clump is associated with a high number of affected files (41), which suggests a widespread issue across the codebase. Refactoring this data clump could lead to significant improvements in code maintainability and reduce the risk of errors when changes are made to the parameter group. By introducing a new class or struct to encapsulate these parameters, we can simplify method signatures and make the code more readable and easier to manage."
