  "justification": "The classes JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme both contain a clump of fields related to UI theming, such as primary colors, secondary colors, and fonts. These fields share a common domain of UI theming, which suggests that they can be grouped into a separate Theme class that encapsulates all the related properties. This would make the code more modular, easier to maintain, and would facilitate potential extensions of theming options in the future.",
