  "justification": "This data clump has the highest occurrence count (434), indicating that the parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', 'h' are used together very frequently across 41 different files. This suggests significant duplication and a strong case for encapsulating these parameters into a single object to represent a coordinate or dimension, which would greatly simplify method signatures and improve code maintainability."
