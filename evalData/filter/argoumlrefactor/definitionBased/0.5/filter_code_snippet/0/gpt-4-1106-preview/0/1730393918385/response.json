    "justification": "The data clump consisting of primary1, primary2, and primary3 ColorUIResource fields exists in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. These fields represent a theme's primary colors and are likely to be used in similar ways across different theme classes, suggesting that they share a common domain of theming. Refactoring these fields into a separate class could reduce duplication across theme-related classes and centralize color theme management.",
