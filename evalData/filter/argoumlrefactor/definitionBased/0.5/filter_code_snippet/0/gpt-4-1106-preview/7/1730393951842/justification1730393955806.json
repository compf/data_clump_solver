  "justification": "The data clump consisting of primary1, primary2, and primary3 ColorUIResource fields appears in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates that these color resources are shared across multiple theme files, which likely affects the theming functionality across the application. Refactoring this data clump would improve maintainability by centralizing the color definitions and making it easier to manage themes.",
