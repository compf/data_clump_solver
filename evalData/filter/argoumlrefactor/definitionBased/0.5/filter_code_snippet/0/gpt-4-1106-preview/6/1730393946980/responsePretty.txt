    "justification":"The data clump consisting of the ColorUIResource fields (primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, secondary3) and the FontUIResource fields (controlFont, systemFont, windowTitleFont, userFont, smallFont) is present in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java. This indicates a significant level of duplication across multiple files, which can lead to higher maintenance costs and potential for errors when changes are made. By refactoring this data clump, we can ensure that any changes to the theme's color or font resources are centralized, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and simplifying the codebase.",
