  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has the highest occurrence count, appearing 434 times and affecting 41 files. This suggests a significant amount of duplication across multiple files. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a substantial reduction in code duplication, leading to a codebase that is easier to maintain and less prone to errors caused by changes in the data structure."
