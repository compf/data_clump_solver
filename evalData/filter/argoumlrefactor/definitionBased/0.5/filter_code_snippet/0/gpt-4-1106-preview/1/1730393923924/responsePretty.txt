    "justification": "The method 'buildAssociationEnd' with parameters (assoc, name, type, multiplicity, stereo, navigable, order, aggregation, scope, changeable, visibility) is present in multiple classes (CoreFactory, CoreFactoryMDRImpl) and is a prime example of a data clump due to its repeated occurrence across different files. This leads to code duplication and makes the codebase harder to maintain.",
