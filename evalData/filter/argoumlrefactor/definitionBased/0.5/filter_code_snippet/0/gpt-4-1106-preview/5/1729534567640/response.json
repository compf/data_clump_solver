    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is chosen because it affects a significant number of files (41), which implies that the duplication of these parameters is widespread across the codebase. Addressing this data clump would lead to a more maintainable and cleaner code by reducing the number of places where changes need to be made if the data structure changes.",
