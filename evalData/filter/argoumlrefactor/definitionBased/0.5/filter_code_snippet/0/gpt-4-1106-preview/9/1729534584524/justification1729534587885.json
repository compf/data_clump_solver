  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 21 times across a significant number of files (41). This indicates that there is a repeated pattern which, if refactored, could greatly reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. By extracting these parameters into a separate class, we can encapsulate the related data and potentially simplify method signatures throughout the affected files.",
