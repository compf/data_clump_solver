    "justification": "The fields primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, and secondary3 in both JasonsBigTheme.java and JasonsHugeTheme.java classes represent color resources that are part of a common domain, which is the theme's color palette. These fields are repeated across two classes, suggesting that they belong to a specific concept related to theming. Refactoring these fields into a separate class would encapsulate the color palette logic, reduce duplication, and improve the code's maintainability.",
