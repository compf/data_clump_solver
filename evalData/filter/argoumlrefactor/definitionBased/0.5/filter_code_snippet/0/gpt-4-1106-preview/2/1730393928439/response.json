    "justification":"The data clump with key 0 involves ColorUIResource fields (primary1, primary2, primary3, secondary1, secondary2, secondary3) and FontUIResource fields (controlFont, systemFont, windowTitleFont, userFont, smallFont) that are repeated across two different files, 'JasonsBigTheme.java' and 'JasonsHugeTheme.java'. This suggests that both files are defining similar or identical theme-related resources, which could be abstracted into a separate class to encapsulate the theme properties and reduce duplication across files.",
