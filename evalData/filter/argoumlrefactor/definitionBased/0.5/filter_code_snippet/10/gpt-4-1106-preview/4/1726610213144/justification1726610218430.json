  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has a high occurrence rate (434 times) and affects a significant number of files (41 files), which indicates that it is a common pattern that is repeated throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump would likely lead to a substantial reduction in code duplication and improve the maintainability of the code by centralizing the common logic related to the parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', 'h' into a single structure or method. This could potentially simplify future changes and bug fixes related to these parameters."
