    "justification":"The data clump with key 58 has a high occurrence count of 21, indicating that it is a common pattern repeated across multiple files (41 affected files). This suggests that there is significant duplication of this set of parameters, which could be reduced by refactoring the code to encapsulate them into a single class. By addressing this data clump, we can reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and make future changes to this group of parameters easier to manage.",
