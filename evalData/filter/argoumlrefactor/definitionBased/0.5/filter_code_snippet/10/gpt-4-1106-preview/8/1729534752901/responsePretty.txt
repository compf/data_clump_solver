    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 affects 41 files and occurs 21 times, which indicates a significant amount of duplication across a large number of files. By refactoring this data clump, we can simplify the codebase by reducing redundancy and making it easier to maintain and understand. The parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', 'h' likely represent coordinates and dimensions, which are commonly used together in graphical user interfaces for positioning and sizing elements. Encapsulating these parameters into a single object would make the code cleaner and more modular.",
