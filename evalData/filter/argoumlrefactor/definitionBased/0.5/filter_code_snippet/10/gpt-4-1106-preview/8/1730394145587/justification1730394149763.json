  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 is a set of parameters (x, y, w, h) that represent dimensions and position of a graphical element, which are used across multiple methods in different classes related to the user interface. This clump occurs very often as graphical elements are a core part of the application's UI rendering system, leading to significant duplication of these parameters across the codebase.",
