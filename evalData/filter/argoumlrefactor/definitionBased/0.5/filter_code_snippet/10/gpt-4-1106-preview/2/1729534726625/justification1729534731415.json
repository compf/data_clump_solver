  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 58 is chosen because it affects a significant number of files (41), which implies that refactoring this data clump would potentially reduce complexity and duplication across a large portion of the codebase. By extracting the parameters x, y, w, h into a separate class, we could improve the code maintainability and readability by encapsulating the position and size properties that are likely to be related. This change would simplify method signatures and make the code more modular.",
