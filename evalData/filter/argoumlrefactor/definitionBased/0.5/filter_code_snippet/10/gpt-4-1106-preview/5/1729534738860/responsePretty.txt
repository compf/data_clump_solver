    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 affects a significant number of files (41), which suggests that there is a widespread pattern that could be encapsulated into a separate class. By refactoring this data clump, we could potentially reduce the complexity and improve the maintainability of a large portion of the codebase. The parameters involved (x, y, w, h) represent a common set of coordinates and dimensions, which are likely to be used together in various parts of the application related to graphical user interface components.",
