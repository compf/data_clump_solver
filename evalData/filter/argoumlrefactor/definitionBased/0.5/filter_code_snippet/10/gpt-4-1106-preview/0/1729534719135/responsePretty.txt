    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 affects 41 files, which indicates that a significant part of the codebase relies on the same set of parameters. Refactoring this data clump would potentially reduce duplication across a large number of files, improving maintainability and reducing the risk of errors when changes are made to the related functionality.",
