    "justification": "The methods addClassModelEventListener and removeClassModelEventListener in ModelEventPump.java both have the same three parameters (listener, modelClass, propertyNames), indicating a frequent occurrence of this data clump. This repetition suggests that these parameters are logically related and are used together in multiple places, leading to code duplication and a higher chance of errors when making changes.",
