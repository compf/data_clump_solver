    "justification":"The AssociationEndRole class has three common fields with the parameters of the buildAssociationEnd method of the CollaborationsFactory interface. The AssociationEndRole class is a domain class that represents the end of an association in a collaboration context, and the buildAssociationEnd method is responsible for creating instances of this class. Since the parameters of this method are closely related to the fields of the AssociationEndRole class, it makes sense to extract these parameters into a separate class to encapsulate the concept of an association end in a collaboration context. This will improve the domain model by making it more cohesive and reducing duplication.",
