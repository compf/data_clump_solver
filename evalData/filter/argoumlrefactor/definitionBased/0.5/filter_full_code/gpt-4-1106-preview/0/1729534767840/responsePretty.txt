    "justification":"The variables 'primary1', 'primary2', and 'primary3' in JasonsBigTheme.java represent a set of related color resources used for theming. They share a common domain of color values and are used together to define the primary color theme. By extracting these variables into a separate class, we can encapsulate the theme-related properties, making the code more maintainable and reusable. For example, if we want to create another theme with a different set of primary colors, we can simply create a new instance of the extracted class with different values.",
