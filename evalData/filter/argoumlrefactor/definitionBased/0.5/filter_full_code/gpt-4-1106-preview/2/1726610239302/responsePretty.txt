    "justification":"The 'JasonsHugeTheme' class contains several fields and methods related to UI theming, such as color resources, font resources, and methods to get these resources. These variables share a common domain of UI theming, which suggests that extracting a class to encapsulate them would be beneficial for organization and maintainability. By creating a separate class to handle theme-related properties, it becomes easier to manage different themes and make changes to the UI appearance without affecting other parts of the codebase."
