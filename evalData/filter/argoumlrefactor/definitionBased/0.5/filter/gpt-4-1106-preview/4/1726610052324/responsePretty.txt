justification:"
The data clump with key 0 involves multiple fields related to font and color resources in UI themes (JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme). These fields represent a specific domain of UI theming, and extracting them into a separate class would not only reduce duplication but also encapsulate the theme-related properties in a more coherent and manageable way. This would improve the code's maintainability and readability, and it would make it easier to extend or modify the theme system in the future.
