    "justification":"The data clump from key 0 involves a large number of fields (11 in total) that are common between two classes (JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme). This suggests significant duplication of code related to UI theming, which could be centralized in a single class or a hierarchy of theme classes. By refactoring this data clump, we could simplify the design, improve maintainability, and reduce the potential for errors in the future whenever theme-related changes are required.",
