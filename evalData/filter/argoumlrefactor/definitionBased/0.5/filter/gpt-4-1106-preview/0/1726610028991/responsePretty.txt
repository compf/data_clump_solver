justification:"
The data clump between 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' classes includes a significant number of Font and Color resources, which are clearly related to UI theming. Extracting these fields into a separate Theme class would encapsulate the theming concerns and promote reusability as well as easier maintenance of UI themes. Such a refactoring would also simplify the two classes by removing the UI resource clutter from them.
