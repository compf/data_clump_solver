  "justification": "The data clump from 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' involves a significant number of fields (11 in total) that are identical in terms of their names, types, and modifiers. This suggests a strong case for refactoring to reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and encapsulate the related theme attributes into a cohesive unit. Consolidating these fields into a single class that can be shared by both 'JasonsBigTheme' and 'JasonsHugeTheme' will simplify the codebase and reduce the complexity associated with managing parallel changes across these classes."
