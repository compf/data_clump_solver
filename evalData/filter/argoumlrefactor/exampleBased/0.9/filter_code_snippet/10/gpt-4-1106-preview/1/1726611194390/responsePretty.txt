    "justification":"The data clump with key 58 has a high number of affected files (41 files). This suggests that a significant portion of the code base relies on the specific combination of parameters (x, y, w, h). By refactoring these parameters into a single object representing a rectangle or a bounding box, the code duplication across numerous files could be reduced significantly, potentially leading to easier maintenance and less room for errors when handling these coordinate and dimension parameters."
