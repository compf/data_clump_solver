    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 434 times across 41 affected files. This high frequency of repetition leads to extensive duplication, making it a prime candidate for refactoring in order to improve code maintainability and reduce potential for errors. Consolidating these parameters into a class or struct would simplify the method signatures and make the codebase more manageable."
