  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The 'x, y, w, h' parameters appear in methods across 41 files with a total occurrence of 434 times. This high frequency indicates a common pattern that is repeatedly used throughout the codebase, signifying that it's a central part of the layout and rendering logic. Encapsulating these coordinate and size parameters into a single object could greatly reduce code duplication and improve maintainability and readability, especially considering how widespread the usage is."
