    "justification": "The data clump with key 58 affects 41 files with a very high occurrence of 434 times. This means that the same set of parameters (final Object owner, final int x, final int y, final int w, final int h) is reused across a large number of different locations, which suggests a high level of code duplication and tight coupling. Refactoring this data clump could greatly reduce the complexity of the codebase and make it easier to maintain, potentially leading to better modularization and fewer errors when the parameters need to be modified or extended."
