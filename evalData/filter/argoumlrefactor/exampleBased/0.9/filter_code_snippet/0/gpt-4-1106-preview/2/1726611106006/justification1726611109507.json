  "justification": "The selected data clump has a very high occurrence of 434, which suggests that the same set of parameters is being duplicated across many parts of the application. Reducing this duplication can significantly improve code maintainability and decrease the potential for errors when making changes. Refactoring this common set of parameters into an object or struct can make the codebase more readable, easier to manage, and pave the way for further code improvements."
