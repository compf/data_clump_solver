  "justification": "The selected data clump is based on the method parameter occurrence metric, which has a significant count of 434 occurrences across 41 affected files. This high frequency of occurrence across many files indicates substantial duplication and the potential for widespread impact on maintainability. Refactoring this pattern will improve the codebase's consistency and reduce the likelihood of future errors or inconsistencies related to the method signature. By extracting a parameter object or using a strategy to encapsulate this set of parameters, the code can become more readable and easier to manage."
