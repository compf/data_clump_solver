    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 occurs a significant number of times (434 occurrences) across numerous files (41 files affected). This clump involves the `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` parameters which are likely to represent coordinates and dimensions. Given the high frequency and the number of files impacted, refactoring this data clump could lead to a substantial reduction in duplication and improve the maintainability of the codebase. It suggests that these parameters represent a concept that is widely used throughout the system (such as a bounding box or a rectangular area), which would benefit from its own class abstraction."
