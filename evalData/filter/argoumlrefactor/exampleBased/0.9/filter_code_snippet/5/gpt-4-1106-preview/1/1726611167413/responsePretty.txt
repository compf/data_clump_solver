",
justification:"
The data clump identified by key 58 has a significant impact due to the high number of affected files (41 files) and the highest occurrence (434 times) among all provided examples. This suggests that there is a substantial amount of duplicated code which may lead to higher maintenance costs, the risk of inconsistent changes, and reduced code clarity. By refactoring this clump, we can encapsulate coordinates and dimensions (x, y, w, h) into a single class or structure, which could likely simplify the API and reduce errors across a large number of affected files.
