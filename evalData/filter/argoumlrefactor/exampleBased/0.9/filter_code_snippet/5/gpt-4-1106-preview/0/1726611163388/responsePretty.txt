    "justification": "The data clump in keys 58 affects a high number of files (41) and has a very large number of occurrences (434). This extensive duplication could lead to inconsistencies and increased maintenance complexity across numerous diagrams, which is why it is vital to refactor it. Extracting the parameters into a context object or a new method signature as appropriate could significantly reduce duplication and improve code maintainability and readability."
