    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58, with 4 parameters (final int x, final int y, final int w, final int h), occurs a significant number of times (434 occurrences) across a substantial number of affected files (41). This high frequency of duplicate code indicates that it is likely a large amount of boilerplate is spread across the codebase. By refactoring this data clump and encapsulating these common parameters into a dedicated class (e.g., a 'Rectangle' or 'Dimensions' class), the code can be made more maintainable and the risk of inconsistencies or errors introduced by future changes can be reduced."
