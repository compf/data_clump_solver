  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "I chose the data clump with key 58 because it appears in 41 affected files with a high occurrence of 434 times. Reducing this clump will eliminate a significant amount of parameter duplication throughout a large number of files and therefore will likely improve maintainability and consistency across the codebase."
