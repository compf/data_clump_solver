  "key": "58",
  "reason": "affected_files",
  "justification": "The selected data clump affects a significant number of files (41), indicating a widespread pattern that could benefit from refactoring. Eliminating this duplication will likely improve maintainability of the code base by localizing changes to the related attributes. Considering that the size of the clump is moderate but the occurrence is high across many files, refactoring this clump provides a substantial benefit in terms of reducing code duplication and potential inconsistencies."
