  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The data clump in question is related to the parameters for the setBounds and createActivationFig methods, which appear in a large number of occurrences throughout the codebase, as indicated by the occurrence metric (434 times). This suggests that the clump is a common pattern that could be refactored to reduce duplication and improve maintainability. Given the high frequency of this clump, refactoring it could lead to significant improvements in code quality and reduce the risk of errors when these methods are called in multiple places."
