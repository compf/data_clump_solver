    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 occurs very often, with 434 occurrences across a significant number of files (41 files). This frequent duplication suggests that refactoring this data clump would lead to a meaningful reduction in code duplication and improve maintainability. By encapsulating these parameters into a single object or using a pattern like a builder or factory, the code could be made cleaner and more modular, making future changes to related functionality easier to implement and understand."
