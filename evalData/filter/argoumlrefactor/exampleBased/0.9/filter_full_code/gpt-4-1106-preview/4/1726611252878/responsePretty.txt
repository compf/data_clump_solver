    "justification":"This example involves the refactoring of the method 'buildServiceKey' and 'buildKey'. These methods are found in class 'Example1A', which is part of the 'example 5' data clump. The refactoring involves extracting the common parameters into a new class called 'KeyData'. This data clump significantly affects the codebase as it tidies up the repeated use of the parameters 'path', 'group', and 'version' across multiple methods. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class reduces duplication and improves clarity. It also adheres to the principle of single responsibility, as the 'KeyData' class now handles the grouping of these parameters."
