    "justification":"The 'data clump' in the file 'Example1A' is spread across multiple methods and the three parameters 'path', 'group', and 'version' are consistently used together in the two main methods 'buildServiceKey' and 'buildKey', making it a prime candidate for refactoring. By introducing a new class 'KeyData' to encapsulate these parameters, the code becomes cleaner, and the use of the 'data clump' is more coherent and maintainable. The refactoring also affects the file structure and organization, which is why 'affected_files' is the most appropriate reason for this choice."
