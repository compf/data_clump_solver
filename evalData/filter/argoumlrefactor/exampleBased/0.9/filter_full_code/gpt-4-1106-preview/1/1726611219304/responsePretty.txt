    "justification": "The examples provided represent data clumps where fields or parameters are grouped together in various methods or classes, and these groups are repeated in multiple places. Among the examples, the 'data fields to fields' clump from Example 2 is the most important to refactor because it occurs very often, creating duplication and tightly coupling the classes 'Example2A' and 'Example2B' with the same three fields: states, successors, and labels. This repetition makes the code less maintainable, as any change to this group of fields would require updates in multiple locations. Refactoring it into the 'StateGraphData' class encapsulates the related data, improving maintainability, reducing duplication and decreasing the likelihood of introducing bugs when changes are made to this group of fields."
