    "justification":"The class org.argouml.uml.diagram.collaboration.ui.FigMessage has data clumps in the form of method parameters that are repeatedly used together, such as 'sourceFigNode', 'destFigNode', and 'figMessage'. These parameters are related to the concept of a message in a collaboration diagram and could be refactored into a separate class to represent a message more cohesively."
