justification:"
The data clump in 'Example1A' is chosen because it affects multiple files. Having a data clump that spans across multiple files can lead to higher maintenance costs and increased risk of errors when changes are made. By refactoring this data clump, we can encapsulate the related data into a single class, improving code readability, maintainability, and reducing the chance of introducing bugs when modifying one of the related methods or classes.
