    "justification":"The 'data clump' in example 5 affects multiple files, which indicates that there is a significant amount of duplication that could be reduced through refactoring. By extracting the shared parameters into a class, the code becomes more maintainable and easier to understand. Additionally, this refactoring would also help in making changes to the shared parameters in the future, as they would be centralized in one location rather than duplicated across multiple methods and files."
