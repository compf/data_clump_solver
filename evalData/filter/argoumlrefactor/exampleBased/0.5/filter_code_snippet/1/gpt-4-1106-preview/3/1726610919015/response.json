    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58, which includes the parameters (final int x, final int y, final int w, final int h), occurs very frequently across a large number of files (41 files) with a high occurrence rate (434 times). This indicates a widespread pattern that is consistently used throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump to a single object representing a rectangle or bounds would significantly reduce duplication, improve code readability, and make future changes to the concept of positioning and sizing elements much easier to manage."
