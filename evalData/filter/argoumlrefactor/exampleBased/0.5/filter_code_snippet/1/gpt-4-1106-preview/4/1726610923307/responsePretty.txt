The data clump identified by key 58, which consists of four parameters (x, y, w, h), occurs a high number of times (434 occurrences) across a large number of files (41 files). This suggests that these parameters are commonly used together throughout the codebase, and refactoring them into a single object could significantly reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
