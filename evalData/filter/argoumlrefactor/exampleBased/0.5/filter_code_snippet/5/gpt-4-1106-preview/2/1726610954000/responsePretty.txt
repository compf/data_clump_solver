    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence metric of 434, which means that the duplication of parameters is widespread throughout the codebase, affecting 41 files. This frequent repetition of parameter lists in method signatures indicates that the clump is a common pattern that could benefit significantly from refactoring. By introducing a parameter object or other refactoring strategies, we can reduce the duplication, improve code readability, and make future changes easier to implement."
