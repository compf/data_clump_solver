    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 occurs 434 times across 41 affected files. This high frequency of occurrence and the significant number of affected files indicate that this data clump leads to a considerable amount of duplication in the codebase. Refactoring it into a single method or class could greatly reduce redundancy and improve maintainability."
