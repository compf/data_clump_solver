    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has the highest occurrence metric, appearing 434 times across 41 files. This indicates that the clump is not only widespread across the codebase but also frequently repeated, which can lead to significant code duplication and maintenance challenges. Refactoring this data clump would likely yield the most substantial improvements in terms of reducing redundancy and simplifying the codebase."
