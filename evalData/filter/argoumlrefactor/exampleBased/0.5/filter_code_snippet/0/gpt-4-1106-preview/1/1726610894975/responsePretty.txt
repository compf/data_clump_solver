    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 is chosen for refactoring due to its high occurrence across many files, leading to significant duplication. With 41 affected files and 434 occurrences, this clump suggests a common pattern that is repeated throughout the codebase. Refactoring this clump into a single cohesive structure would greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability."
