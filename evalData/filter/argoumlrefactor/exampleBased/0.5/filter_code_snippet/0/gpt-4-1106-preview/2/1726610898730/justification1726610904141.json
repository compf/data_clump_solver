  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has an occurrence of 434, which is the highest among the provided examples. This indicates that the clump appears very often, leading to a significant amount of duplication across 41 affected files. Refactoring this data clump would likely result in a considerable reduction of code duplication, improved maintainability, and easier updates or changes to the method signatures in the future."
