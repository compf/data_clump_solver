The data clump identified by key 58 is most important to refactor because it occurs a significant number of times (434 occurrences) across a large number of files (41 files). This indicates that the same set of parameters is being used repeatedly in different parts of the codebase, which can lead to duplication and maintenance issues. By refactoring this data clump, the code can be made more modular, reducing the risk of errors and making it easier to understand and change in the future.
