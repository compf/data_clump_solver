  "key": "58",
  "reason": "occurrence",
  "justification": "The chosen data clump is identified by key 58 and involves the parameter list (final int x, final int y, final int w, final int h). This data clump was selected due to its high occurrence, appearing 434 times across 41 affected files. Such frequent repetition indicates significant duplication of code structure, which can lead to maintenance challenges and increased risk of inconsistencies. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure would greatly simplify the codebase, making it easier to manage and understand, as well as facilitating any future changes to the representation or processing of these parameters."
