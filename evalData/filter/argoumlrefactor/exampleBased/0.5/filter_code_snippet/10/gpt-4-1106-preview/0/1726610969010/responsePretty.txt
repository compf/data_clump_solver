    "justification":"The data clump identified by key 58 is chosen due to its high occurrence across many files, which implies a widespread pattern of duplication. The clump consists of four parameters (x, y, w, h) that likely represent coordinates and dimensions, a common concept in graphical user interfaces. By extracting these parameters into a separate class or structure, the codebase can be significantly simplified and made more maintainable. The high occurrence of this clump suggests that it is a fundamental part of the system's design, and addressing it could lead to improvements in many areas of the application."
