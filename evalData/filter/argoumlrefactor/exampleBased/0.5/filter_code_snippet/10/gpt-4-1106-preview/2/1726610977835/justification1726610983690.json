  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence count of 434 across 41 affected files. This indicates that the clump is widespread throughout the codebase and refactoring it could potentially reduce a significant amount of duplication and improve maintainability. Given the impact across multiple files and the frequency of occurrence, addressing this data clump should be a high priority."
