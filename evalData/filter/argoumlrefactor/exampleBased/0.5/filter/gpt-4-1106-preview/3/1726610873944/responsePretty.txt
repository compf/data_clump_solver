    "justification": "This data clump involves a significant number of fields (11 fields) related to UI resources such as fonts and colors. The large size of this clump indicates that it encapsulates a substantial portion of the theme's appearance settings, making it a prime candidate for refactoring. Extracting these fields into a separate class would improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability across different themes, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and errors when making changes to the UI appearance."
