    "justification": "The data clump identified in key 0 has a significant number of fields (11 fields) that are duplicated across two classes (JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme). This indicates a large potential for reducing duplication and improving maintainability by extracting these fields into a separate class. This will not only reduce the size of the clump but also encapsulate the theme-related properties in a more coherent and reusable manner."
