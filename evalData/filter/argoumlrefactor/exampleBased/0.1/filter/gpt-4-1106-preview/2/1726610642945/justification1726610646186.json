  "key": "0",
  "reason": "size",
  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 0 has a significant number of fields (11 fields) that are duplicated across two classes (JasonsBigTheme and JasonsHugeTheme). This large number of fields suggests a high potential for creating a more cohesive and reusable class that encapsulates these fields. Refactoring this data clump would likely improve the maintainability of the code by reducing duplication and making the relationship between these fields explicit."
