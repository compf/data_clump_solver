    "justification":"The 'data clump' in example 5 is chosen because it affects multiple files, which can lead to duplication and maintenance issues. By refactoring this clump into a class, we can encapsulate the related data and reduce the coupling between different parts of the codebase. This can improve code readability, reusability, and make future changes easier to manage."
