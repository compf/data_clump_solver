justification:"
The 'fields to fields' data clump in Example2A and Example2B classes is a significant example because it affects multiple files. The fields 'states', 'successors', and 'labels' are repeated across two different classes, leading to duplication and potential inconsistencies. By extracting these fields into a separate class (StateGraphData), we encapsulate the related data and reduce duplication, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand. This refactoring also promotes better separation of concerns and enhances the ability to extend or modify the state graph data handling in the future without affecting unrelated parts of the code.
