    "justification": "The 'fields to fields' data clump in Example2A and Example2B classes is significant because it affects multiple files. The repeated use of 'states', 'successors', and 'labels' fields in both classes indicates a strong relationship between these fields, suggesting that they should be encapsulated into a single class. This refactoring would improve the maintainability of the code by reducing duplication and making the relationship between these fields explicit. By extracting these fields into a 'StateGraphData' class, we can reduce the risk of inconsistencies and errors when modifying the state graph data, as changes would only need to be made in one place. Additionally, this refactoring would make the codebase more modular and easier to understand for developers who are new to the project or revisiting the code after some time."
