justification:"
The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence metric of 434, indicating that it is repeated many times across the codebase. This repetition suggests that there is significant duplication of code involving the parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h', which likely represent coordinates and dimensions. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure could greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the management of these related values.
