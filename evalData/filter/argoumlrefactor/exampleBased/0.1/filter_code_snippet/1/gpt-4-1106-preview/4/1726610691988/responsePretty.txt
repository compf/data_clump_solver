The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence of 434 times across 41 affected files. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication that, if refactored, could significantly reduce the complexity and improve the maintainability of the codebase. By extracting the common parameters into a single class or structure, we can encapsulate the related data and provide a clearer and more reusable interface for the methods that currently share this data clump.
