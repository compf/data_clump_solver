    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58, which consists of four parameters (x, y, w, h), occurs very frequently with a total of 434 occurrences across 41 affected files. This suggests that there is a common pattern of specifying dimensions and positions that could be encapsulated into a single object, potentially reducing duplication and improving code maintainability."
