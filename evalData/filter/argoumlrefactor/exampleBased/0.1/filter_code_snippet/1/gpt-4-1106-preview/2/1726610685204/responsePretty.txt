    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 434 times across 41 affected files. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication that, if refactored, could significantly reduce code complexity and improve maintainability. By extracting these parameters into a separate class or structuring them differently, we can encapsulate related data, making the codebase more modular and easier to understand."
