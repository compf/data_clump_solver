    "key": "58",
    "reason": "occurrence",
    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 434 times across 41 affected files. This suggests that the clump is a common pattern in the codebase, leading to significant duplication. Refactoring this clump would likely result in a more maintainable and less error-prone codebase by reducing the number of places where changes need to be made when the clump's logic is modified."
