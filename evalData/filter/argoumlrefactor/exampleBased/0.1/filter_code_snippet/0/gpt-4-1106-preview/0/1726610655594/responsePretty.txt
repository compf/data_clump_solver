    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence count of 434, which indicates that it is repeated across many instances in the codebase. This repetition suggests that the parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h' are commonly used together and represent a significant portion of the code that could benefit from refactoring. By extracting these parameters into a single object, we can reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the code. Although the size of the clump is relatively small (only 4 parameters), the high occurrence makes it a prime candidate for refactoring."
