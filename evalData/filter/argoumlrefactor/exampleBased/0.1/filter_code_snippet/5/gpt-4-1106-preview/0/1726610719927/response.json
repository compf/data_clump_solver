    "key": "58",

    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence count of 434, which indicates that it is a common pattern repeated across 41 files. This suggests that there is significant duplication of code involving the parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h', which likely represent coordinates and dimensions. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure could greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the management of these related values."
