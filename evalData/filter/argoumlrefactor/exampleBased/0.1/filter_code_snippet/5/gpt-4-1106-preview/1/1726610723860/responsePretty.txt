    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, which indicates a significant amount of duplication. Refactoring this data clump would likely reduce the complexity and improve maintainability of the codebase by centralizing the common structure of the method parameters into a single class or structure."
