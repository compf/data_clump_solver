justification:"
The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence rate, appearing 434 times across 41 affected files. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication that, if refactored, could significantly reduce the complexity and improve the maintainability of the codebase. By extracting this data clump into a separate method or class, we can encapsulate the repeated logic and make future changes easier to implement.
