  "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 is chosen due to its high occurrence across multiple files, which indicates a significant amount of duplication. Refactoring this data clump would likely reduce the complexity of the codebase and improve maintainability by centralizing the common logic related to setting bounds and creating activation figures."
