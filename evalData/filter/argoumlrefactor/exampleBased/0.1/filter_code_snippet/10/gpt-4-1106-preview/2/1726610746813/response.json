    "justification": "The data clump identified by key 58 has a high occurrence of 434 times across 41 affected files. This indicates a widespread pattern of duplication that, if refactored, could significantly reduce the complexity and improve maintainability of the codebase. By extracting these parameters into a single object, we can encapsulate the related data and simplify method signatures, which will make the code easier to understand and modify."
