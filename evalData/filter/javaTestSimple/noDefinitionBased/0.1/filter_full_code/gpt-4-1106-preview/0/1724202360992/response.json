This repetition suggests that x, y, and z may be part of a higher-level concept, such as a 3D vector, that is not currently represented in the code. Refactoring this data clump into a Vector3D class, for example, could improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of errors when manipulating these related values together.\"\n}\n",
