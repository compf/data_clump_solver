This suggests that these parameters are likely related and could potentially represent a concept or entity that should be encapsulated in its own class. Refactoring this data clump can improve code maintainability by reducing duplication and making the relationships between these parameters explicit. Additionally, since the methods involved are 'printSum' and 'printMax', it is likely that these parameters represent numerical values that are being operated on, which is a core part of the functionality in a class named 'MathStuff' or 'BetterMathStuff'. Encapsulating these parameters could lead to more reusable and understandable code.\"\n}",
