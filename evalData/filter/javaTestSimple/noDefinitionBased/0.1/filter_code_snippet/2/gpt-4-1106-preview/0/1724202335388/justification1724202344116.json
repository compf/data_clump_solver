  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 4 is identified in multiple locations across different files (MathStuff.java and Library.java) and has a high occurrence count of 42. It consists of three fields: sign, mantissa, and exponent, which suggests that these fields are likely related to a concept that could be encapsulated in its own class (e.g., a 'Number' or 'FloatingPointNumber' class). Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the risk of errors when dealing with these related fields. Additionally, since it affects three different files, the impact of the refactoring would be significant, potentially simplifying the interactions between classes and making the codebase more modular."
