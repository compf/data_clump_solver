  "key": "0",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 0, which consists of a boolean 'sign', a double 'mantissa', and an int 'exponent', is present in 3 different files with a total of 38 occurrences. This suggests that these three variables are likely to represent a concept that is widely used across the codebase, such as a floating-point number with its sign, mantissa, and exponent parts. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or struct could greatly reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. It would also make the code more readable and easier to understand, as the related data would be encapsulated in a single, coherent abstraction. Additionally, this refactoring could potentially simplify methods that operate on these variables by allowing them to accept a single object instead of three separate parameters."
