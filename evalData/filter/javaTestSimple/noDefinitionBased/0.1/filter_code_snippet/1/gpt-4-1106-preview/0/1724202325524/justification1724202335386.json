  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 4, which consists of the fields 'sign', 'mantissa', and 'exponent', is present in 3 different files and occurs 40 times. This indicates that these fields are likely to represent a concept that is widely used across the codebase. By refactoring this data clump into a separate class, we can encapsulate the related data and operations, improve code readability, and reduce the risk of errors when these fields are used together. Additionally, this change could simplify the maintenance of the codebase and make it easier to extend the functionality related to this concept in the future."
