  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 4, which consists of a boolean 'sign', a double 'mantissa', and an int 'exponent', is present in 3 different files and occurs 44 times. This suggests that these variables are likely to represent a common concept or a data structure that is used throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or structure could improve code maintainability, reduce redundancy, and enhance clarity by encapsulating the related data. Additionally, it could facilitate changes to the representation of this concept without affecting multiple places in the code. Given the high occurrence and the fact that it spans multiple files, addressing this data clump could have a significant positive impact on the codebase."
