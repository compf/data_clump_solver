  "key": "0",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 0 is the most important to refactor because it affects 3 different files and occurs 46 times. This indicates that the sign, mantissa, and exponent fields are likely a concept that should be encapsulated in its own class. By creating a new class for this data clump, we can reduce duplication and improve the code's maintainability. Additionally, since these fields are related to numerical representation, it's likely that they are used together in various mathematical computations, which further supports the need for a cohesive abstraction."
