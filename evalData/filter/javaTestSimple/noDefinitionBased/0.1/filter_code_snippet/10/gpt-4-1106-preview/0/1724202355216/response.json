This indicates that the sign, mantissa, and exponent fields are likely a concept that should be encapsulated in its own class. By creating a new class for this data clump, we can reduce duplication and improve the code's maintainability. Additionally, since these fields are related to numerical representation, it's likely that they are used together in various mathematical computations, which further supports the need for a cohesive abstraction.\"\n}\n",
