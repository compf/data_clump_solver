  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 4, which is a 'parameters_to_parameters_data_clump', has been chosen for refactoring because it represents a common set of method parameters (x, y, z of type int) that are used across different methods in different classes (printSum in MathStuff and printMax in BetterMathStuff). This repetition of parameters suggests that these values are related and might represent a cohesive piece of data that can be better managed as a single object. By refactoring this data clump into a new class, we can encapsulate the related parameters, making the code more maintainable, reducing the risk of errors when passing around multiple parameters, and improving the clarity of method signatures. Additionally, if the methods are performing operations on these parameters, encapsulating them into a single object can make it easier to add new functionality or modify existing behavior in a single location rather than in every method that uses these parameters."
