Refactoring this data clump into a separate class would reduce duplication and improve maintainability by encapsulating the representation of a number with its sign, mantissa, and exponent in one place. This change would make the codebase easier to understand and modify, as changes to the representation would only need to be made in one location rather than across multiple classes. Additionally, it could potentially simplify methods that operate on these fields by allowing them to accept a single object representing the number rather than three separate parameters.\"\n}",
