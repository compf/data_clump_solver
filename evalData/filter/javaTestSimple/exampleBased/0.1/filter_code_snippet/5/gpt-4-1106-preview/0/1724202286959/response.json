By refactoring this data clump into a separate class, we can encapsulate the related data and reduce duplication. This will make the codebase more maintainable and reduce the risk of errors when these fields need to be modified or used in calculations. Additionally, creating a class to represent this data clump can lead to more reusable code and potentially simplify the implementation of mathematical operations that depend on these fields.\"\n}",
