  "key": "0",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 0 is identified as the most important to refactor because it has a high occurrence across multiple files (26 occurrences in 3 different files), indicating that the sign, mantissa, and exponent fields are a common grouping of data that is likely to be used together in various parts of the application. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class could improve code maintainability by reducing duplication and making the codebase easier to understand. It would also encapsulate the floating-point representation logic in one place, potentially simplifying any future changes to how these values are handled within the system."
