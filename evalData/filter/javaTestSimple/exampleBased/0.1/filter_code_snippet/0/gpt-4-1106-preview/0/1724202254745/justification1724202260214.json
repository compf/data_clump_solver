  "key": "0",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 0 is identified in multiple files (affected_files: 3) and has a high number of occurrences (occurrence: 24), indicating that the sign, mantissa, and exponent fields are used together frequently across different parts of the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class could greatly reduce duplication and improve maintainability by encapsulating the related data into a single coherent structure. This would make the code easier to understand and modify, as changes to the representation of this data would only need to be made in one place. Additionally, it could potentially simplify method signatures that currently take these fields as separate parameters."
