This indicates that the same group of fields is used repeatedly across multiple classes, which can lead to duplicated code and increased maintenance effort. By refactoring this data clump into a separate class, we can encapsulate the related fields, reduce duplication, and improve the code's modularity and readability. Additionally, this change could simplify future changes to the data structure, as modifications would only need to be made in one place rather than across multiple classes.\"\n}",
