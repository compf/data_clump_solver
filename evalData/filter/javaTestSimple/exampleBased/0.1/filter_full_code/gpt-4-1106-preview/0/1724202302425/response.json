This repetition of parameters across multiple methods is a classic example of a data clump. These parameters are likely to be used together in other parts of the system as well, indicating that they form a natural grouping. Refactoring these methods to accept a single 'Vector3' object that encapsulates the x, y, and z components would simplify the method signatures and make the code more maintainable. It would also make it easier to add additional vector-related operations in the future without further increasing the number of parameters.\"\n}",
