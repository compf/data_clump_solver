This kind of structural duplication can lead to a higher maintenance cost, as changes to the common fields would need to be replicated across both classes. Refactoring this data clump could involve creating a new class that encapsulates these fields, thus promoting better encapsulation and reducing the duplication. This can also improve the design of the system by making it more modular and easier to understand. The fields 'exponent', 'mantissa', and 'sign' suggest that they might represent a numerical concept that could be abstracted into its own class, potentially improving the domain model of the application.\"\n}",
