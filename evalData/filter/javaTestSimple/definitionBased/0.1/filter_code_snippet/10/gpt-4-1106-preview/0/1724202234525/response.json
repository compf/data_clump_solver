This indicates that the boolean sign, double mantissa, and int exponent are used together frequently across multiple files. Refactoring this data clump into a single class or a structure would not only reduce the duplication of code but also encapsulate the related data, making the codebase more maintainable and understandable. Additionally, since these fields are likely to represent a numerical concept that is used in mathematical operations, grouping them together makes logical sense and could potentially simplify method signatures that operate on these fields.\"\n}",
