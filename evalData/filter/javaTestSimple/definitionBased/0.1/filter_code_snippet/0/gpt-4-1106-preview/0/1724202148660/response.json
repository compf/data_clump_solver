This clump involves three fields (sign, mantissa, exponent) that are common across multiple classes, suggesting that these fields are likely related and could represent a concept that is not yet encapsulated in its own class. By refactoring this data clump into a separate class, we can improve the code's modularity, reduce duplication, and make the codebase easier to maintain. Additionally, since these fields are used in multiple places, any changes to their handling would only need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of bugs and inconsistencies.\"\n}",
