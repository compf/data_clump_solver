  "key": "0",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 0 is identified in two different classes (Library and MathStuff) and consists of three fields: 'sign', 'mantissa', and 'exponent'. This clump has a high impact due to its occurrence in multiple files (affected_files: 3) and a high number of occurrences (occurrence: 14). Refactoring this data clump by creating a new class to encapsulate these fields would improve the code's modularity, reduce duplication, and make the codebase easier to maintain. Additionally, since these fields are likely related to representing a number with a sign, mantissa, and exponent (possibly a floating-point number), encapsulating them makes sense from a domain modeling perspective."
