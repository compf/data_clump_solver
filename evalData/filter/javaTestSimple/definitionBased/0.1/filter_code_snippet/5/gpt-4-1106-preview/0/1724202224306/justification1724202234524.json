  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 4 is identified in three different files (MathStuff.java, BetterMathStuff.java, and Library.java) and has a high occurrence count of 16. This indicates that the clump is widespread across the codebase, affecting multiple classes. The clump consists of three fields: sign, mantissa, and exponent, which are likely related to representing a floating-point number or a mathematical entity. Refactoring this clump into a separate class would improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and encapsulate the concept of a number with its sign, mantissa, and exponent in a single place. This change would make the code more readable and easier to manage, especially if operations on these fields are common. Additionally, it could potentially simplify method signatures that currently require these fields as parameters by allowing the passing of a single object instead."
