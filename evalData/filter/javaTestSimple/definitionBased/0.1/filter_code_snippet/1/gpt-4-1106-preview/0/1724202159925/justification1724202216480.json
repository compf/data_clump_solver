  "key": "4",
  "justification": "The data clump with key 4 is identified in multiple locations across different classes (MathStuff and Library) and has a high occurrence count (12 times). It consists of three fields: sign, mantissa, and exponent. These fields are likely related to a mathematical concept or a data structure that is used throughout the codebase. Refactoring this data clump into a separate class or a structure could improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and make the code more modular. By encapsulating these fields into a single concept, it would be easier to manage and understand their usage, and it would also simplify method signatures that require these fields as parameters. Additionally, this change could potentially simplify the interaction between classes and lead to better separation of concerns."
