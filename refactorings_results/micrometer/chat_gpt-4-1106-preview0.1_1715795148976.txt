After examining the provided code in `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java`, it does not seem to have any data clumps according to the given definition. The majority of methods in this class are private utilities related to metric registration and do not share a common set of parameters outside of their scope. Also, there are no obvious groups of fields or method parameters, which would qualify as data clumps to be extracted into separate classes.

Thus, refactoring is not required for this particular piece of code. If there were any data clumps, the refactoring process would involve creating new classes that encapsulate these groups of parameters or fields and adjusting all relevant methods to use instances of those new classes instead. However, based on the current state of the code, no such changes are applicable.

In summary, the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class does not exhibit any patterns that would necessitate the refactoring of data clumps.
