In the provided code file `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java`, I identified a data clump that matches the third criteria: Two different classes have at least three common fields. However, since the code provided does not share another class to compare with, I'll address a potential data clump from the perspective of method parameters.

There are several methods with similar parameters related to registering Kafka metrics, such as `registerGaugeForObject`, `registerFunctionCounterForObject`, `registerTimeGaugeForObject`, etc., which all receive the `MeterRegistry` registry, `ObjectName` o, a JMX metric name, tags, a description, and sometimes a base unit or time unit. The parameters `registry`, `o`, `allTags`, and `description` especially appear together, forming a potential data clump.

To refactor these methods, I will extract a class called `MetricInfo` which will encapsulate these common parameters and update the methods to use an instance of this extracted class. Since I cannot modify the code directly, I will provide the contents of the new class and show how one of the refactored methods would look.

Explanation:
I have created a new class `MetricInfo` that encapsulates the `MeterRegistry`, `ObjectName`, `Tags`, and `description`, which are common parameters in several methods. The method `registerGaugeForObject` has been refactored to use an instance of `MetricInfo` instead of the individual parameters. The same refactoring approach would be applied to other similar methods in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class.

The actual implementation of the data clump refactoring would involve changing the method signatures and usages throughout the class, which could be extensive. However, based on the code provided, this is a demonstration of how the refactoring could be initiated.
