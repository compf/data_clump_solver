To refactor the code in `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java` based on the data clump definition, it seems there are no explicit data clumps according to the definition provided. The methods that take multiple parameters in the class are mostly private, and they do not share a common set of parameters to form a data clump. Furthermore, there are no other classes or overridden methods provided to verify against the definition of data clumps.

The methods that could potentially be considered to have data clump candidates (`registerGaugeForObject`, `registerFunctionCounterForObject`, `registerTimeGaugeForObject`) actually have different parameters or overloaded versions rather than a consistent set of parameters shared across different methods.

Since there are no explicit data clumps to be refactored in the provided `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java` file according to the definition, no refactoring will be performed. If there were other classes or files provided where data clumps were identified based on the definition given, the refactoring could be pursued by introducing parameter objects or consolidating fields into classes.

This finding suggests that the `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java` file does not need refactoring with respect to data clumps as per the provided definition and available context.
