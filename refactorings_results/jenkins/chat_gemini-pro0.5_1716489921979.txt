It looks like the data clump is present in parameters of `onScriptExecution`, `onScriptOutput`, and other methods that include `Object feature`, `Object context`, and `String correlationId`. Additionally, in some cases, `User user` is also included in the clump. This can be refactored by creating a new class to encapsulate these fields. We'll call this class `ScriptEventDetails`.

Here is the content of the extracted class, `ScriptEventDetails`:

```java
import hudson.model.User;

public class ScriptEventDetails {
    private final Object feature;
    private final Object context;
    private final String correlationId;
    private final User user; // Optional, based on use-case

    public ScriptEventDetails(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {
        this.feature = feature;
        this.context = context;
        this.correlationId = correlationId;
        this.user = user;
    }

    // Getters for fields
    public Object getFeature() {
        return feature;
    }

    public Object getContext() {
        return context;
    }

    public String getCorrelationId() {
        return correlationId;
    }

    public User getUser() {
        return user;
    }
}
```

Now, we can refactor the methods by replacing the parameters with an instance of the extracted class. Here's how the refactored `onScriptExecution` method looks like:

```java
default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {
}
```

Similar changes will be made to `onScriptOutput`, `fireScriptExecution`, `fireScriptOutput`, and all other methods and constructors where this data clump occurs. The usage within these methods will need to be updated accordingly to access the parameters through the new `ScriptEventDetails` object.

For example, the call to `fireScriptExecution` will change from:

```java
ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, GroovyshCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());
```

To:

```java
ScriptEventDetails details = new ScriptEventDetails(GroovyshCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());
ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, details);
```

And similarly, in the `ListenerWriter` class:

```java
public ListenerWriter(Writer writer, ScriptEventDetails details) {
    this.writer = writer;
    this.details = details;
}

@Override
public void write(@NonNull char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {
    ScriptListener.fireScriptOutput(String.copyValueOf(cbuf, off, len), details);
    writer.write(cbuf, off, len);
}
```

The same refactoring will be applied to the `DefaultScriptListener`, `GroovyCommand`, `GroovyshCommand`, `RemotingDiagnostics`, and `GroovyHookScript` classes, ensuring that all methods and their usages are updated to use `ScriptEventDetails` where the data clump was present.

This refactoring will encapsulate related information and reduce the parameter list, which will make the code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to understand.
