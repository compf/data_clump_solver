Based on the provided Java files, it appears that there are common fields and method parameters in different methods and classes that conform to the definition of a data clump. Specifically, fields `feature`, `context`, `correlationId`, and `user` appear to be a clump. We can extract these into a new class, which we could name `ScriptEventDetails`, and refactor the methods and constructors to use this new class.

Let's create the extracted class:

```java
import hudson.model.User;

public class ScriptEventDetails {
    private final Object feature;
    private final Object context;
    private final String correlationId;
    private final User user;

    public ScriptEventDetails(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {
        this.feature = feature;
        this.context = context;
        this.correlationId = correlationId;
        this.user = user;
    }

    public Object getFeature() {
        return feature;
    }

    public Object getContext() {
        return context;
    }

    public String getCorrelationId() {
        return correlationId;
    }

    public User getUser() {
        return user;
    }
}
```

Now, let's refactor the method signatures and usages in `ScriptListener.java` by replacing the data clump fields with the `ScriptEventDetails` class:

```java
// Original method signature:
void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user);

// Refactored method signature:
void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, ScriptEventDetails details);

// Original method call:
ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, feature, context, correlationId, user);

// Refactored method call:
ScriptEventDetails details = new ScriptEventDetails(feature, context, correlationId, user);
ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, details);

// Do the same for the onScriptOutput method and its usages, and also apply this to other classes and methods listed in the files that have the same data clump.
```

Repeat the refactoring process for `ScriptListener.onScriptOutput`, `ListenerWriter` constructor, the implementation in `DefaultScriptListener`, and usages in other classes, such as `GroovyCommand`, `GroovyshCommand`, `RemotingDiagnostics`, and `GroovyHookScript`.

Note that for each refactoring, you'll need to create a `ScriptEventDetails` instance and pass it where it's required. This will also mean updating all call sites and possibly other interfacing methods that utilize these clumped data.

This refactoring will lead to a more maintainable and cleaner codebase with reduced duplication and improved object-oriented structure.
