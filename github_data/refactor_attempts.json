The `LogAction` class now has only one method that is responsible for logging the report information, making it easier to understand what the class does and how it works.","","Here's an example of how we can use this refactored code:","```java","// src/main/java/org/traccar/helper/LogActionTest.java","package org.traccar.helper;","","import java.text.DateFormat;","import java.util.Arrays;","import java.util.Date;","import java.util.List;","import org.junit.Test;","import static org.junit.Assert.*;","","public class LogActionTest {","","    @Test","    public void testLogReport() {","        DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\");","        List<Long> deviceIds = Arrays.asList(1L, 2L);","        List<Long> groupIds = Arrays.asList(3L, 4L);","        LogAction.logReport(10L, true, \"report\", new Date(), new Date(), deviceIds, groupIds);","    }","","}","```","In this example, we have a test method that calls the `LogAction.logReport()` method with some sample data. This helps ensure that the refactored code works as expected and makes it easier to test and maintain the code."],["[PYTHON]","# This script is based on the previous one, but it uses Python instead of

The first data clump is related to the parameters of the `create`, `edit`, and `remove` methods. These methods all have at least 3 common parameters: `userId`, `object`, and `id`.

and date range. It uses the Jxls library to generate an Excel report from a template file.","","Here's a brief overview of its main methods:","","1. `getObjects(long userId, Collection<Long> deviceIds, Collection<Long> groupIds, Collection<String> types, Date from, Date to)`: This method retrieves events for the given devices and groups within the specified date range that match the provided event types. It filters out events where geofences or maintenance items are not found in the user's accessible objects.","","2. `getExcel(OutputStream outputStream, long userId, Collection<Long> deviceIds, Collection<Long> groupIds, Collection<String> types, Date from, Date to)`: This method generates an Excel report containing event data similar to the one produced by the `getObjects()` method. It iterates through accessible devices, fetches their events within the given date range, and includes geofence names, maintenance names, and position details in the report.","","The class utilizes various utility methods from the `reportUtils` field to handle object retrieval, period validation, Excel template processing, and more. The `config` field holds configuration settings for the application."]],"0.1":[["## MARKDOWN","*** src/main/java/org/traccar/helper/LogAction.java","Java```java","import java.beans.Introspector;","import java.text.DateFormat;","import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;","import java.util.Date;","import java.util.List;","","import org.slf4j.Logger;","import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;","import org.traccar.model.BaseModel;","","public final class LogAction {","","    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LogAction.class);","","    private LogAction() {","    }","","    private static final String ACTION_CREATE = \"create\";","    private static final String ACTION_EDIT = \"edit\";","    private static final String ACTION_REMOVE = \"remove\";","","    private static final String ACTION_LINK = \"link\";","    private static final String ACTION_UNLINK = \"unlink\";","","    private static final String ACTION_LOGIN = \"login\";","    private static final String ACTION_LOGOUT = \"logout\";","","    private static final String ACTION_DEVICE_ACCUMULATORS = \"deviceAccumulators\";","","    private static final String PATTERN_OBJECT = \"%d %s %s %d\";","    private static final String PATTERN_LINK = \"%d %s %s %d %s %d\";","    private static final String PATTERN_LOGIN = \"%d %s %s\";","","    public static void logObjectAction(String action, long userId, Class<?> clazz, long objectId) {","        LOGGER.info(String.format(","                PATTERN_OBJECT, userId, action, Introspector.decapitalize(clazz.getSimpleName()), objectId));","    }","","    public static void logLinkAction(","            String action, long userId, Class<?> owner, long ownerId, Class<?> property, long propertyId) {","        LOGGER.info(String.format(","                PATTERN_LINK, userId, action,","                Introspector.decapitalize(owner.getSimpleName()), ownerId,","                Introspector.decapitalize(property.getSimpleName()), propertyId));","    }","","    public static void logLoginAction(String action, long userId, String remoteAddress) {","        if (remoteAddress == null || remoteAddress.isEmpty()) {","            remoteAddress = \"unknown\";","        }","        LOGGER.info(String.format(PATTERN_LOGIN, userId, action, remoteAddress));","    }","","    public static void logReport(","            long userId, boolean scheduled, String report,","            Date from, Date to, List<Long> deviceIds, List<Long> groupIds) {","        DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\");","        LOGGER.info(String.format(","                PATTERN_REPORT, userId, scheduled ?

However, I can give you a general guideline on how to identify data clumps and how to refactor them.","","Data clumps occur when you see the same data hanging around together in multiple parts of your program, often passed together in method calls. These can be an indication that the data should be grouped into a single entity.","","Here's a generic process to address data clumps:","","1. **Identify Data Clumps:**","   Look for groups of variables that are passed together in method signatures or are often found together in class fields. Common indications of data clumps can include:","   - Repeated groups of parameters in multiple method signatures.","   - Instance variables that are frequently used together in multiple methods.","","2. **Create a Class to Encapsulate the Data Clump:**","   If you identified a group of variables that are used together frequently, consider creating a new class to hold this set of data.","","3. **Replace the Data Clump with the New Class:**","   Replace the individual pieces of data with an instance of the new class throughout the code.","","A basic example:","```java","// Potential data clump: x, y, and z are used together frequently.","public void doSomething(int x, int y, int z) {","    // Implementation","}","","public void doAnotherThing(int x, int y, int z) {","    // Implementation","}","```","","Refactoring to use a new class:","```java","// New class to encapsulate the data clump.","public class Coordinate {","    private int x;","    private int y;","    private int z;","","    public Coordinate(int x, int y, int z) {","        this.x = x;","        this.y = y;","        this.z = z;","    }","","    // Getters and setters...","}","","// Refactored methods","public void doSomething(Coordinate coord) {","    // Implementation","}","","public void doAnotherThing(Coordinate coord) {","    // Implementation","}","```","","If you have a specific code example or need advice on a particular set of methods or variables, please share a snippet or a detailed description, and I can provide a more tailored response."],["As an AI, I don't have direct access to your `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class or any specific codebase. However, based on the standard definition of data clumps, I can guide you on how to identify them and provide information on what they are.","","Data clumps are code smells that occur when the same few data items frequently appear together in multiple class methods, suggesting that they might belong together in their own class. To spot a data clump, look for the following signs within a class:","","- Groups of variables or parameters that often show up together in several function signatures.","- Methods that always take several parameters together.","","For example, if you have several methods that all require parameters like `host`, `port`, and `protocol`, those parameters might form a data clump that could be replaced with a new class (e.g., `ConnectionInfo`).","","Refactoring data clumps usually involves creating new structures to hold the clumped data. Here's a simple example:","","Let's say we have a `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class with methods that often use `brokerName`, `topic`, `partition` together:","","```java","public class KafkaConsumerMetrics {","    // Other fields and methods...","    ","    public void recordConsume(String brokerName, String topic, int partition, long time) {","        // Implementation","    }","    ","    public void recordProduce(String brokerName, String topic, int partition, long time) {","        // Implementation","    }","    ","    // More methods that use brokerName, topic, and partition","}","```","","You might refactor this by creating a new class called `TopicPartition`:","","```java","public class TopicPartition {","    private String brokerName;","    private String topic;","    private int partition;","    ","    public TopicPartition(String brokerName, String topic, int partition) {","        this.brokerName = brokerName;","        this.topic = topic;","        this.partition = partition;","    }","    ","    // Getters and other methods","}","```","","And then update the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to use the new `TopicPartition`:","","```java","public class KafkaConsumerMetrics {","    // Other fields and methods...","    ","    public void recordConsume(TopicPartition topicPartition, long time) {","        // Implementation using topicPartition","    }","    ","    public void recordProduce(TopicPartition topicPartition, long time) {","        // Implementation using topicPartition","    }","    ","    // More methods now using the TopicPartition class","}","```","","By introducing the `TopicPartition` class, you encapsulate the data clump into a single object, making the code cleaner, easier to understand, and to maintain. If you notice such patterns in your KafkaConsumerMetrics class, consider doing a similar refactoring."],["I'm sorry, but it looks like you've provided a code snippet and asked for assistance without context.

These parameters are being passed around together in various methods, which is a data clump as per the definition provided.","","To refactor this code to remove the data clumps, we will create a class that encapsulates these parameters and then refactor the methods to use instances of this new class. Let's call this class `JmxMetricAttributes`.","","Here's the content of the new class `JmxMetricAttributes`:","","```java","package io.micrometer.core.instrument.binder.kafka;","","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry;","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tags;","import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;","import javax.management.ObjectName;","","public class JmxMetricAttributes {","    private final MeterRegistry registry;","    private final ObjectName objectName;","    private final String jmxMetricName;","    private final Tags allTags;","    private final String description;","    private final String baseUnit;","    private final TimeUnit timeUnit;","","    public JmxMetricAttributes(MeterRegistry registry, ObjectName objectName, String jmxMetricName, Tags allTags,","                               String description, String baseUnit, TimeUnit timeUnit) {","        this.registry = registry;","        this.objectName = objectName;","        this.jmxMetricName = jmxMetricName;","        this.allTags = allTags;","        this.description = description;","        this.baseUnit = baseUnit;","        this.timeUnit = timeUnit;","    }","","    // Getters and potentially other methods are omitted for brevity.","}","```","","Next, we will refactor the `registerGaugeForObject` and `registerTimeGaugeForObject` methods in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to use `JmxMetricAttributes`. Due to the length of the code, only modified method prototypes are shown here.","","Please note that the entire codebase needs to be refactored for this change, including the construction of `JmxMetricAttributes` instances and the invocation of the refactored methods.","","Here are the updated method prototypes using the `JmxMetricAttributes` class:","","```java","private Gauge registerGaugeForObject(JmxMetricAttributes attributes) {","    // Implementation details...","}","","private TimeGauge registerTimeGaugeForObject(JmxMetricAttributes attributes) {","    // Implementation details...","}","```","","I will now update the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to use these new methods. The full refactored code will not be provided here due to its length, but you would need to update all usages of `registerGaugeForObject` and `registerTimeGaugeForObject` to construct a `JmxMetricAttributes` instance and then pass it to these methods. This will involve changes throughout the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class.","","Here's an example of how the usage might change:","","```java","// Old usage","Gauge gauge = registerGaugeForObject(registry, objectName, jmxMetricName, allTags, description, baseUnit);","","// New usage after refactoring","JmxMetricAttributes attributes = new JmxMetricAttributes(registry, objectName, jmxMetricName, allTags, description,","                                                          baseUnit, null); // `null` can be used for TimeUnit if not applicable.","Gauge gauge = registerGaugeForObject(attributes);","```","","The full refactoring is beyond the scope of this platform, but these changes should give you a template for how to proceed with the refactoring for the entire class. The primary goal is to ensure that all instances where these parameters are clumped together are replaced with the use of the `JmxMetricAttributes` class, thus reducing the coupling and improving the maintainability of the code."],["Actually, the refactored suggestion provided above might not be the best approach for handling the information necessary to register a Kafka metric with Micrometer. The `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class is designed to collect and register Kafka consumer metrics with a Micrometer `MeterRegistry`. Its methods require various parameters to create and register Micrometer metrics correctly.","","Refactoring every single method to use a `JmxMetricInfo` object, as suggested, might lead to more complex and less readable code, especially if the methods require additional context-specific information that does not fit neatly into the `JmxMetricInfo` abstraction.","","Let's take a step back and instead aim to illustrate how the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class might be refactored to improve cohesion and readability. One approach is to focus on the process of creating a specific type of metric (e.g., gauge, counter), providing a clear and coherent interface for that process.","","For example, you might consider creating a builder or factory class dedicated to constructing a specific type of metric:","","```java","public class MetricBuilder {","    private final MeterRegistry registry;","    private final MBeanServer mBeanServer;","","    public MetricBuilder(MeterRegistry registry, MBeanServer mBeanServer) {","        this.registry = registry;","        this.mBeanServer = mBeanServer;","    }","","    public Gauge buildGauge(String name, ObjectName objectName, String jmxMetricName, String description, String baseUnit, Tags tags) {","        // Your code for building and registering a Gauge...","    }","","    // Other methods for different metric types...","}","```","","Then, within the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class, you can leverage this builder:","","```java","public class KafkaConsumerMetrics implements MeterBinder {","    // current class code...","","    private void registerMetrics(MeterRegistry registry) {","        MetricBuilder metricBuilder = new MetricBuilder(registry, mBeanServer);","","        // Example usage for registering a gauge","        Gauge bytesConsumedPerSec = metricBuilder.buildGauge(\"kafka.consumer.bytes.consumed\", objectName, \"BytesPerSec\",","                                                             \"The average number of bytes consumed per second\", \"bytes\",","                                                             Tags.of(\"client.id\", clientId));","        ","        // repeat for other metrics...","    }","}","```","","This refactoring approach keeps `KafkaConsumerMetrics` focused on the high-level process of identifying and registering Kafka consumer metrics while delegating the details of creating and registering each metric type to `MetricBuilder`. It also makes the `registerMetrics` method more concise and easier to understand.","","The ultimate goal of any refactoring should be to improve code clarity, maintainability, and cohesion. Any approach taken should be weighed against the specific needs and design of your application and the context in which the class operates."],["The Java code provided in the question is designed to help with the monitoring of Kafka Consumers. By using the `Micrometer` library, it registers various metrics that reflect the operational state and performance of the Kafka Consumers, which is instrumental in observability and system diagnostics. Here's a detailed explanation of the different components in the code:","","### Key Components:","","1. **`MeterRegistry`:**","    - Micrometer's `MeterRegistry` is the central concept that holds a collection of all the metrics instruments. It enables you to register various types of metrics like gauges, counters, timers, etc., and is responsible for publishing them to different monitoring systems.","","2. **`ObjectName`:**","    - `ObjectName` is a class from Java's `javax.management` package. It's used to identify MBean(s) (Managed Beans) uniquely. Here, it's used to represent the Kafka Consumer metrics which are exposed as JMX (Java Management Extensions) MBeans.","","3. **`Tags`:**","    - `Tags` is a Micrometer concept used to attach labels to metrics. They are key-value pairs that provide additional context and metadata, beneficial when querying and aggregating metrics.","","4. **`Gauge`, `FunctionCounter`, and `TimeGauge`:**","    - These are different types of metric instruments registered with the `MeterRegistry`.","    - A `Gauge` is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.","    - `FunctionCounter` is a type of counter whose value is derived from a function that is invoked whenever it's being exported.","    - `TimeGauge` is a gauge for tracking the duration of time.","","5. **`METRIC_NAME_PREFIX`:**","    - A constant defining a prefix that is applied to the metric names when they are registered. This usually helps in organizing metric names under a common namespace.","","6. **`mBeanServer`:**","    - Generally, an instance of the `MBeanServer` interface allows interaction with the MBean(s). This includes querying MBeans and retrieving their attributes which are the metrics.","","7. **`getJmxAttribute`:**","    - A method that seems to be responsible for extracting metric values from JMX MBeans attributes. The exact implementation isn't shown in the excerpt.","","8. **`registerGaugeForObject`, `registerFunctionCounterForObject`, and `registerTimeGaugeForObject`:**","    - These are methods designed to create and register various metric instruments based on the provided JMX attributes, names, tags, and other metadata. They likely instantiate the Metric (Gauge/Counter/etc.) with specific options and retrieve the metric data from the JMX `ObjectName` provided.","","### Code Functionality:","","- The code registers gauges, function counters, and time gauges for Kafka consumer metrics.","- The metrics are retrieved from the JMX MBeans (`ObjectName` parameter) of the Kafka Consumers.","- Metrics are registered under names prefixed with `METRIC_NAME_PREFIX`.","- The methods accept tags that can be attached to the metrics for better filtering and querying.","- Descriptions and possibly units (`baseUnit`) are used to give context to the metrics, making them understandable for humans and compatible with metric systems which can interpret these fields.","","### Conclusion:","","Overall, this Java code is likely part of a larger monitoring and observability framework for Kafka Consumers. It enables the collection of various operational metrics in a structured and exportable manner, with the intention of being consumed by systems such as Prometheus, Grafana, or any other monitoring system that integrates with Micrometer."],["Your approach for refactoring the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to remove the data clump is correct. By introducing a new `KafkaMBeanMetricContext` class to encapsulate the `ObjectName`, `Tags`, and `List<Meter>`, you're improving the maintainability and readability of the code. In addition, this change could also simplify future modifications and extensions related to the handling of these properties.","","When you implement this kind of refactoring, it's important to ensure that the rest of the class and the related classes recognize and integrate the new class properly. All places where the clump of data was previously passed around should be updated to use the `KafkaMBeanMetricContext`.","","Your code snippets show a proper way of introducing the refactor, and including the changes in the `registerMetricsEventually` and `addUnregistrationListener` methods to utilize the new class. This encapsulation makes it much clearer what data belongs together, and also reduces the risk of future errors when adding or changing functionality in the code related to Kafka JMX metric handling.","","Make sure to thoroughly test these changes, as refactoring can sometimes introduce unexpected issues, especially in the way objects are passed around and used. It's also advisable to look for other methods in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class that might benefit from this new encapsulation and update them accordingly."],["Please note that my previous response included markdown formatting that may not be required for your use case.

The data clump consists of multiple parameters that are frequently passed together: `MeterRegistry registry`, `ObjectName o`, `String jmxMetricName`, `Tags allTags`, `String description`, and an optional `String baseUnit`.","","To refactor this, we can introduce a new class that encapsulates these parameters, which we can call `MetricInfo`, and modify the methods to take a single `MetricInfo` object instead of the individual parameters. Here's an example of how you could do it:","","First, define the `MetricInfo` class:","","```java","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry;","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tags;","","import javax.management.ObjectName;","","public class MetricInfo {","    private final MeterRegistry registry;","    private final ObjectName objectName;","    private final String jmxMetricName;","    private final Tags tags;","    private final String description;","    private final String baseUnit; // This could be optional (nullable)","","    public MetricInfo(MeterRegistry registry, ObjectName objectName, String jmxMetricName, Tags tags, String description, String baseUnit) {","        this.registry = registry;","        this.objectName = objectName;","        this.jmxMetricName = jmxMetricName;","        this.tags = tags;","        this.description = description;","        this.baseUnit = baseUnit;","    }","","    // Getters for all fields","}","```","","Then, refactor the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` methods to use `MetricInfo`:","","```java","// Example of refactoring the registerGaugeForObject method","private void registerGaugeForObject(MetricInfo metricInfo) {","    // ... logic to register the gauge using metricInfo's properties","}","```","","After the class and methods are refactored, you would create a `MetricInfo` object and pass it to the methods instead of individual parameters:","","```java","// Example of using the refactored registerGaugeForObject method","MetricInfo metricInfo = new MetricInfo(registry, objectName, jmxMetricName, allTags, description, baseUnit);","registerGaugeForObject(metricInfo);","```","","You would repeat this refactoring pattern for the other methods mentioned (`registerFunctionCounterForObject` and possibly others that have the same data clump).","","Remember to adjust method implementations accordingly, replacing direct parameter use with the appropriate getter from the `MetricInfo` object.","","This refactoring will not only clean up the parameter lists but also make it easier to extend or modify the metrics-related functionality in the future. If you need to add, remove, or change a common metric property, you can now do it in one place in the `MetricInfo` class."],["The provided definition of data clumps refers to the situation where the same data is passed around together in various parts of a program and may be better represented as its own object. Based on the description, it seems that the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` Java file likely contains several methods that pass around the same pieces of data as arguments. While the actual code is not provided here, I can describe a general approach to refactoring the code to address this issue.","","Firstly, you would identify the data clumps, which could be a set of parameters that are frequently passed together to different methods. For example, let's suppose that multiple methods in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class have the following parameters:","","```java","ObjectName objectName,","String jmxMetricName,","String meterName,","Tags allTags","```","","To address the data clump, you could create a new class that encapsulates these parameters.

Here's an example of a refactored method:","","```java","public void registerMetric(MetricDescriptor descriptor) {","    // Implementation goes here, using descriptor's getters to access the fields","}","```","","The final step would be to update all the places where the original methods were called. Instead of passing individual arguments, you'd create an instance of `MetricDescriptor` and pass it to the method:","","```java","MetricDescriptor descriptor = new MetricDescriptor(objectName, jmxMetricName, meterName, allTags);","kafkaConsumerMetrics.registerMetric(descriptor);","```","","This approach reduces the overall complexity and improves the maintainability of the code by encapsulating related data in a single object."],["This is a complex refactoring task which involves understanding the relationships between the fields and method parameters.

We can also see that `MeterRegistry registry` is frequently passed along with these parameters, but we will keep it separate as it does not fit the formal definition of a data clump with the others (it's not in a group of at least three).","","We will create a class called `KafkaMetricInfo` that consolidates these related parameters and update the method signatures to accept an instance of this new class instead.

We can extract these into a new class, which we could name `ScriptEventDetails`, and refactor the methods and constructors to use this new class.","","Let's create the extracted class:","","```java","import hudson.model.User;","","public class ScriptEventDetails {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventDetails(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, let's refactor the method signatures and usages in `ScriptListener.java` by replacing the data clump fields with the `ScriptEventDetails` class:","","```java","// Original method signature:","void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user);","","// Refactored method signature:","void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, ScriptEventDetails details);","","// Original method call:","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, feature, context, correlationId, user);","","// Refactored method call:","ScriptEventDetails details = new ScriptEventDetails(feature, context, correlationId, user);","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, details);","","// Do the same for the onScriptOutput method and its usages, and also apply this to other classes and methods listed in the files that have the same data clump.","```","","Repeat the refactoring process for `ScriptListener.onScriptOutput`, `ListenerWriter` constructor, the implementation in `DefaultScriptListener`, and usages in other classes, such as `GroovyCommand`, `GroovyshCommand`, `RemotingDiagnostics`, and `GroovyHookScript`.","","Note that for each refactoring, you'll need to create a `ScriptEventDetails` instance and pass it where it's required. This will also mean updating all call sites and possibly other interfacing methods that utilize these clumped data.","","This refactoring will lead to a more maintainable and cleaner codebase with reduced duplication and improved object-oriented structure."],["It appears that the data clump we can identify is composed of the following fields/parameters: `Object feature`, `Object context`, `String correlationId`, and `User user`. These are shared across multiple methods and classes (`onScriptExecution`, `onScriptOutput`, `fireScriptExecution`, `fireScriptOutput`, `ListenerWriter`, `OutputStreamDecorator`, `DefaultScriptListener`, etc.).","","We need to create a new class containing these fields and update the method signatures and field declarations to use instances of this new class.","","Let's create a new class called `ScriptEventContext`:","","```java","public class ScriptEventContext {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventContext(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, we'll refactor the methods and constructors in `ScriptListener.java`, `DefaultScriptListener.java`, `ListenerWriter.java`, `OutputStreamDecorator.java`, and any other occurrences to take `ScriptEventContext` as a parameter instead of the individual fields.","","For example, in `ScriptListener.java`, the methods would be refactored as follows:","","```java","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventContext context) {","    // implementation...","}","","default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventContext context) {","    // implementation...","}","","// and so on for other methods where the data clump occurs...","```","","Each call to these methods would require creating an instance of `ScriptEventContext` and passing it accordingly, like so:","","```java","ScriptEventContext context = new ScriptEventContext(feature, scriptContext, correlationId, user);","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, context);","ScriptListener.fireScriptOutput(output, context);","```","","Also, ensure that all the locations where `feature`, `context`, `correlationId`, and `user` were used are now replaced with a single `ScriptEventContext` object and its respective getters, to maintain the same functionality with the refactored code."],["Based on the provided code snippets, it is observable that the `onScriptExecution`, `onScriptOutput`, `fireScriptExecution`, and `fireScriptOutput` methods in the `ScriptListener` interface and corresponding invocations have a data clump with the parameters `Object feature`, `Object context`, `String correlationId`, and `User user`. This data clump also shows in the constructor of `ListenerWriter` and the fields of that class. Additionally, although the number of parameters does not exactly match on all occurrences, an `ScriptEventInfo` class can be created to encapsulate these common parameters.","","Let's create the `ScriptEventInfo` class:","","```java","// Extracted class to encapsulate common fields and parameters","public class ScriptEventInfo {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventInfo(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    // Getters for the fields","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, let's refactor the `ScriptListener` interface to use `ScriptEventInfo`:","","```java","// Refactored methods in the ScriptListener interface","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","}","","default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","}","","// Refactor static fire methods","static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, info));","}","","static void fireScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptOutput(output, info));","}","```","","All corresponding invocations of these methods would then need to be updated to create an instance of `ScriptEventInfo` and pass it in place of the individual parameters. For example:","","Refactoring a method call in `DefaultScriptListener`:","","```java","@Override","public void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","    // ... use getters from `info` ...","    LOGGER.log(Level.FINE, LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.FINEST) ? new Exception() : null,","            () -> \"Execution of script: '\" + script + \"' with binding: '\" + stringifyBinding(binding) + \"' in feature: '\" + info.getFeature() + \"' and context: '\" + info.getContext() + \"' with correlation: '\" + info.getCorrelationId() + \"'\" + userFragment);","}","","@Override","public void onScriptOutput(String output, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","    // ... use getters from `info` ...","    LOGGER.log(Level.FINER, LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.FINEST) ? new Exception() : null,","            () -> \"Script output: '\" + output + \"' in feature: '\" + info.getFeature() + \"' and context: '\" + info.getContext() + \"' with correlation: '\" + info.getCorrelationId() + \"'\" + userFragment);","}","```","","And refactoring calls in other classes:","","```java","// Example of call in GroovyCommand.java","ScriptEventInfo eventInfo = new ScriptEventInfo(GroovyCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, eventInfo);","","// Similar changes would need to be made in all places where fireScriptExecution, fireScriptOutput, or related listener methods are called.","```","","Lastly, update the `ListenerWriter` class to utilize `ScriptEventInfo`:","","```java","public class ListenerWriter extends Writer {","    private final Writer writer;","    private final ScriptEventInfo scriptEventInfo;","","    public ListenerWriter(Writer writer, ScriptEventInfo scriptEventInfo) {","        this.writer = writer;","        this.scriptEventInfo = scriptEventInfo;","    }","","    @Override","    public void write(@NonNull char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {","        ScriptListener.fireScriptOutput(String.copyValueOf(cbuf, off, len), scriptEventInfo);","        writer.write(cbuf, off, len);","    }","}","```","","Perform similar changes in other classes where the data clump is present.

about refactoring a Java class named `KafkaConsumerMetrics`. The refactoring involves creating a new class `ConsumerTags` to encapsulate the tags related to a Kafka consumer (`clientId`, `topic`, and `partition`) and reduce redundancy across different methods that use these tags.","","Let's go into detail about how this refactoring could work:","","1. **Create a `ConsumerTags` class:**","   This class will hold the `clientId`, `topic`, and `partition` strings and provide a method to convert these properties into a collection of tags that can be used by the metrics registry.","","```java","package io.micrometer.core.instrument.binder.kafka;","","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tag;","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tags;","","public class ConsumerTags {","    private final String clientId;","    private final String topic;","    private final String partition;","","    public ConsumerTags(String clientId, String topic, String partition) {","        this.clientId = clientId;","        this.topic = topic;","        this.partition = partition;","    }","","    public Iterable<Tag> toTags() {","        return Tags.of(","            \"client.id\", clientId,","            \"topic\", topic,","            \"partition\", partition","        );","    }","    ","    // Getters could be implemented if needed","}","```","","2. **Refactor `KafkaConsumerMetrics` to use `ConsumerTags`:**","   You will need to identify all the methods within `KafkaConsumerMetrics` that use the `clientId`, `topic`, and `partition` tags, and refactor them to use `ConsumerTags`. Here's an example of how you might refactor a method that creates or collects metrics:","","```java","public class KafkaConsumerMetrics {","    // ... other members and methods ...","","    public void createConsumerMetric(ConsumerTags consumerTags) {","        Tags tags = Tags.of(consumerTags.toTags());","        // Use the tags within this method for creating or collecting metrics","    }","","    // ... additional refactoring to use ConsumerTags in other methods ...","}","```","","3. **Update calls to the refactored methods:**","   After refactoring, any place where the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` methods are called will need to pass an instance of `ConsumerTags` instead of separate strings for `clientId`, `topic`, and `partition`.","","```java","public class SomeOtherClass {","    KafkaConsumerMetrics metrics = new KafkaConsumerMetrics();","","    public void someMethod() {","        ConsumerTags consumerTags = new ConsumerTags(\"client-1\", \"topicA\", \"partition0\");","        metrics.createConsumerMetric(consumerTags);","        // Other usage of metrics with ConsumerTags","    }","}","```","","By following these steps, you would refactor the class to use the new `ConsumerTags` class, which should make the code cleaner and reduce redundancy. Remember, all the code mentioned here is based on the example provided and might require adjustments or additional changes to fit into the actual `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class in your codebase."],["To refactor the data clumps in the provided Java code file, I will introduce a new class to encapsulate the common parameters that form the data clumps. Upon examination of the KafkaConsumerMetrics class, it appears that there are several methods with repeating parameters, particularly `ObjectName`, `Tags`, `String description`, and `@Nullable String baseUnit`. These parameters form a data clump as per the given definition.","","I have created a class named `MetricDescriptor` which encapsulates these parameters. The refactoring involves replacing occurrences of these parameters with instances of `MetricDescriptor` and updating the method calls accordingly.","","Here is the refactored code and the content of the new `MetricDescriptor` class:","","*** MetricDescriptor.java ***","```java","package io.micrometer.core.instrument.binder.kafka;","","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tags;","import javax.management.ObjectName;","import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;","","public class MetricDescriptor {","    private final ObjectName objectName;","    private final Tags tags;","    private final String description;","    private final String baseUnit;","","    public MetricDescriptor(ObjectName objectName, Tags tags, String description, @Nullable String baseUnit) {","        this.objectName = objectName;","        this.tags = tags;","        this.description = description;","        this.baseUnit = baseUnit;","    }","","    // Getters for the fields","    public ObjectName getObjectName() {","        return objectName;","    }","","    public Tags getTags() {","        return tags;","    }","","    public String getDescription() {","        return description;","    }","","    public @Nullable String getBaseUnit() {","        return baseUnit;","    }","}","```","","*** KafkaConsumerMetrics.java (Partial Refactoring) ***","```java","// ... [Other imports] ...","import javax.annotation.Nullable;","","public class KafkaConsumerMetrics implements MeterBinder, AutoCloseable {","    // ...

[Rest of the method] ...","    }","","    // ... [Rest of the class] ...","}","```","","With this refactoring, I've created a new `MetricDescriptor` class and modified the `registerGaugeForObject` method to accept an instance of this class instead of the individual parameters that were contributing to the data clump. The refactoring will help make the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify, as there is now a clear structure representing the concept of a metric descriptor.","","Do note that for the full refactoring, similar changes should be made to all occurrences of these common parameters throughout the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class, replacing them with `MetricDescriptor` instances. The example shown here is just a partial refactoring for illustration purposes."],["It seems like there's been an attempt to provide an example of how to refactor a Java class to improve its design by extracting utility methods into a separate utility class. In the provided example, several methods related to JMX (Java Management Extensions) metric registration have been moved from `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class into a new `JmxMetricsUtil` utility class.","","To clarify the example, here are some key points to note:","","- The utility methods `registerGaugeForObject`, `registerFunctionCounterForObject`, and `registerTimeGaugeForObject` are designed to encapsulate common JMX operations, such as registering gauges and counters with a metrics registry. They have been made `static` because they no longer rely on any instance state.","- Constants like `mBeanServer` and `METRIC_NAME_PREFIX` are passed as parameters to these utility methods to maintain the necessary context required for their operation.","- The `sanitize` method is used to clean up the metric names by replacing certain characters (like hyphens) with a more appropriate character (like a period) for metric naming conventions.","- The `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class implements the `AutoCloseable` interface, providing a `close` method that cleans up any resources or listeners created by the class.","- The refactor should also involve updating the documentation and potentially other parts of the code that interact with these refactored methods.","","This is a common pattern in refactorings aimed at improving the modularity and maintainability of a codebase by isolating specific responsibilities into well-defined, reusable components.","","Note: The actual changes would need to be integrated and tested within the full context of the application to ensure there are no unintended side effects or regressions."],["I've provided you with the refactored Java code for the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class, which now utilizes a new `MetricInfo` class to encapsulate data clumps.

Specifically, it shows the creation of a `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class designed to capture and publish metrics from a Kafka consumer. ","","In the given code, the `bindTo()` method is where most of the work happens. It interacts with the MBean server to query Kafka consumer metrics and registers several gauges and counters to a `MeterRegistry`. ","","Here's a breakdown of the methods used within `bindTo()`:","","- **`registerGaugeForObject()`**: Registers a gauge, a type of meter that reports a single numerical value that can increase and decrease. The method seems to query an attribute from an object registered in the MBean server and binds it to a gauge.","- **`registerFunctionCounterForObject()`**: Registers a function counter, a type of meter that reports a count that is expected only to go up (monotonically increasing). The method seems to query an attribute from an object registered in the MBean server and binds it to a counter.","- **`registerTimeGaugeForObject()`**: Registers a time gauge, which is likely a gauge that measures time intervals. It functions similarly to `registerGaugeForObject()`, but the value reported is expected to represent time.","- **`getJmxAttribute()`**: Returns a function that queries a specific attribute from an `ObjectName`.","","The code also uses the builder pattern extensively to construct and register each metric. This pattern is a common practice in Java, where a chain of method calls is used to set up an object, ending with a call to `.register()` that makes the object immutable and registers it with the `MeterRegistry`.","","For each metric, the code defines parameters such as the metric name, description, base unit, and any relevant tags. These parameters determine how the metric will be reported and can be used to filter and categorize metrics within the monitoring system that the `MeterRegistry` is connected to.","","The code is marked with `@Deprecated`, suggesting that this particular implementation of Kafka metrics binding should no longer be used and that a newer alternative (`KafkaClientMetrics`) is recommended.","","Lastly, the code ensures that each registered metric gets properly unregistered when the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` instance is closed. This is important to prevent resource leaks and ensure that outdated metrics are not reported.","","The file might be a part of a larger monitoring system, where Kafka metrics are essential for observing the performance and behavior of Kafka consumer instances.

Identify the Data Clump:","   Look for groups of variables that are frequently used together in several methods or classes.

This class should encapsulate the variables and provide meaningful methods to interact with the data.","","3. Replace Data Clump with the New Class:","   Go through your code and replace the instances where you use the data clump with the newly created class. This step also involves updating method signatures to use the new class.","","4. Refactor Methods:","   Refactor methods to make use of the new class. This might involve passing the new class as an argument to methods or having methods that previously took the individual elements of the clump now take the new class.","","5. Run Tests:","   If you have unit tests, run them to ensure that you haven't introduced any new bugs. If you don't have tests, it's a good time to write some to solidify your refactor.","","An example might make this clearer. If we had a class that repeatedly used three variables together, we would refactor it like this:","","**BEFORE Refactor:**","```java","public class SomeClass {","    public void someMethod(String name, int age, String address) {","        //... some logic with name, age, and address","    }","    ","    public void anotherMethod(String name, int age, String address) {","        //... some logic with name, age, and address","    }","    ","    // More methods that use name, age, and address together...","}","```","","**AFTER Refactor:**","```java","public class Person {","    private String name;","    private int age;","    private String address;","    ","    // Constructor, getters, and setters...","}","","public class SomeClass {","    public void someMethod(Person person) {","        //... some logic with person","    }","    ","    public void anotherMethod(Person person) {","        //... some logic with person","    }","    ","    // Methods now use the Person class","}","```","","If `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java` has redundant code with a data clump, you would undergo a similar process, creating a new class that represents the data clump, and then updating methods and classes that use that data clump to work with the new class instead.","","Unfortunately, without access to the actual code, I cannot provide a detailed refactoring of `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java`.

The following Java class, `MetricDescriptor`, serves as an example of how you might refactor your code:","","```java","package io.micrometer.core.instrument.binder.kafka;","","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tag;","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tags;","","import javax.annotation.Nullable;","import javax.management.MBeanServer;","import javax.management.ObjectName;","import java.util.Collections;","","public class MetricDescriptor {","    private final MBeanServer mBeanServer;","    private final ObjectName objectName;","    private final Tags allTags;","    private final String description;","    private final String baseUnit;","","    public MetricDescriptor(MBeanServer mBeanServer, ObjectName objectName, Iterable<Tag> tags, String description, @Nullable String baseUnit) {","        this.mBeanServer = mBeanServer;","        this.objectName = objectName;","        this.allTags = Tags.of(tags).and(\"name\", objectName.getKeyProperty(\"name\"));","        this.description = description;","        this.baseUnit = baseUnit;","    }","","    // Getters and any additional behavior, such as creating Meters, go here.","}","```","","Once you have this `MetricDescriptor` class, you can refactor your methods in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to accept an instance of `MetricDescriptor` instead of individual parameters:","","```java","// Example refactored method:","","public Gauge registerGaugeForObject(MeterRegistry registry, MetricDescriptor descriptor, String jmxMetricName) {","    // ...","}","```","","And when you use this method, you'd construct a `MetricDescriptor` first:","","```java","// Example usage:","","ObjectName objectName = ... // your ObjectName instance","Iterable<Tag> tags = ... // your tags","String description = \"Description of your metric\";","String baseUnit = \"units\"; // could be null if not applicable","","MetricDescriptor descriptor = new MetricDescriptor(mBeanServer, objectName, tags, description, baseUnit);","","Gauge gauge = registerGaugeForObject(registry, descriptor, \"jmxMetricName\");","```","","Applying this refactoring approach will clean up your code, making it easier to handle changes to the metric properties in the future, since you will only need to update the `MetricDescriptor` class."],["The provided `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java` file contains a large class responsible for collecting metrics from Kafka consumers.

These are passed around together in various methods like `registerGaugeForObject`, `registerFunctionCounterForObject`, and `registerTimeGaugeForObject`.","","To refactor this code, we could encapsulate these parameters into a new class, perhaps named `MetricDescriptor`.

It will also make it easier to add new metrics-related parameters in the future, as they can be added to the `MetricDescriptor` class without changing method signatures.","","Keep in mind that this is an example, and the actual implementation would require you to define the `MetricDescriptor` class fully, along with its constructor and all necessary getters.

We can extract these parameters into a new class called `ScriptEventContext`.","","Here's the proposed `ScriptEventContext` class:","","```java","public class ScriptEventContext {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventContext(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, let's refactor the `ScriptListener` interface methods to use `ScriptEventContext`:","","```java","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding,","                               @NonNull ScriptEventContext sec) {","}","","default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventContext sec) {","}","```","","We'll also need to update the static methods in `ScriptListener` accordingly:","","```java","static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding,","                                @NonNull ScriptEventContext sec) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, sec));","}","","static void fireScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventContext sec) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptOutput(output, sec));","}","```","","The `ListenerWriter` and other classes with a data clump such as constructors or methods that repeated the clump will also need to use the new `ScriptEventContext`:","","```java","private final Writer writer;","private final ScriptEventContext sec;","","public ListenerWriter(Writer writer, ScriptEventContext sec) {","    this.writer = writer;","    this.sec = sec;","}","","@Override","public void write(@NonNull char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {","    ScriptListener.fireScriptOutput(String.copyValueOf(cbuf, off, len), sec);","    writer.write(cbuf, off, len);","}","```","","This refactoring pattern should be applied to all methods and constructors throughout the given files that have the identified data clump of `feature`, `context`, `correlationId`, and `user`.

user;","","    public ScriptEventDetails(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Next, I'll refactor the methods in the `ScriptListener` interface using the `ScriptEventDetails` class:","","```java","public interface ScriptListener {","    // ...","","    default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","    }","","    default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","    }","","    static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","        Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, details));","    }","","    static void fireScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","        Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptOutput(output, details));","    }","}","```","","For the `ListenerWriter` and similar classes, I'll refactor their constructors and fields to use `ScriptEventDetails`:","","```java","public class ListenerWriter extends Writer {","    private final Writer writer;","    private final ScriptEventDetails details;","","    public ListenerWriter(Writer writer, ScriptEventDetails details) {","        this.writer = writer;","        this.details = details;","    }","","    @Override","    public void write(@NonNull char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {","        ScriptListener.fireScriptOutput(String.copyValueOf(cbuf, off, len), details);","        writer.write(cbuf, off, len);","    }","}","```","","And similarly for the `OutputStream` class:","","```java","public class OutputStream extends OutputStream {","    private final OutputStream os;","    private final Charset charset;","    private final ScriptEventDetails details;","","    public OutputStream(OutputStream os, Charset charset, ScriptEventDetails details) {","        this.os = os;","        this.charset = charset;","        this.details = details;","    }","","    // Rest of the OutputStream methods...","}","```","","I'd also refactor the `DefaultScriptListener` class and all places where `fireScriptExecution` and `fireScriptOutput` are called:","","```java","// In DefaultScriptListener.java","@Override","public void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","    // ...","}","","@Override","public void onScriptOutput(String output, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","    // ...","}","","// In usage within GroovyCommand.java and other classes","ScriptEventDetails details = new ScriptEventDetails(GroovyCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, details);","// ...","```","","By creating the `ScriptEventDetails` class and refactoring all methods and constructors to use this class instead of individual parameters, we successfully eliminate the data clumps and make the code cleaner and more maintainable."],["{","    \"refactorings\": {","

`context`, and `correlationId` parameters which appear together in several methods across multiple classes. Additionally, the `User` parameter is frequently used alongside them. This suggests that these four parameters can be refactored into a single class to encapsulate the related data.","","Here's the refactored class `ScriptEventDetails`:","","```java","public class ScriptEventDetails {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","    ","    public ScriptEventDetails(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, we will refactor the methods and usages accordingly.","","1.

Update `fireScriptExecution` and `fireScriptOutput` static methods in `ScriptListener` and `DefaultScriptListener`:","","```java","// In ScriptListener","static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, details));","}","","static void fireScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptOutput(output, details));","}","","// In DefaultScriptListener","@Override","public void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","    // Existing implementation with details.getFeature(), details.getContext(), details.getCorrelationId(), details.getUser()","}","","@Override","public void onScriptOutput(String output, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","    // Existing implementation with details.getFeature(), details.getContext(), details.getCorrelationId(), details.getUser()","}","```","","3. Update the constructors for `ListenerWriter` and the anonymous `OutputStream`-based class to accept `ScriptEventDetails` instead of individual parameters:","","```java","// In ListenerWriter constructor","public ListenerWriter(Writer writer, ScriptEventDetails details) {","    // Use details.getFeature(), details.getContext(), details.getCorrelationId(), details.getUser()","}","","// Similarly refactor the OutputStream-based class to accept ScriptEventDetails","```","","4. Finally, update the usages in `GroovyCommand`, `GroovyshCommand`, `RemotingDiagnostics`, and `GroovyHookScript` to create instances of `ScriptEventDetails` and pass them to the refactored methods:","","```java","// In GroovyCommand","ScriptEventDetails details = new ScriptEventDetails(GroovyCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, details);","","// Apply similar changes wherever fireScriptExecution or fireScriptOutput are called with feature, context, correlationId, and user.","```","","Make sure that each usage constructs a `ScriptEventDetails` object with the appropriate arguments.

These parameters form a data clump. ","","We can create a new class named `ScriptEventDetails` that encapsulates these parameters.

Here is the refactored `ScriptListener` interface:","","```java","import javax.annotation.CheckForNull;","import javax.annotation.Nonnull;","","public interface ScriptListener {","    default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @Nonnull ScriptEventContext context) {","    }","","    default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @Nonnull ScriptEventContext context) {","    }","","    static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @Nonnull ScriptEventContext context) {","        Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, context));","    }","","    static void fireScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @Nonnull ScriptEventContext context) {","        Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptOutput(output, context));","    }","    ","    // The ListenerWriter and other inner classes constructors and methods should be updated accordingly","}","```","","The `DefaultScriptListener` class might be refactored like so:","","```java","@Override","public void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventContext context) {","    String userFragment = context.getUser() == null ? \" (no user)\" : \" by user: '\" + context.getUser() + \"'\";","    LOGGER.log(Level.FINE, LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.FINEST) ? new Exception() : null,","            () -> \"Execution of script: '\" + script + \"' with binding: '\" + stringifyBinding(binding) + \"' in feature: '\" + context.getFeature() +","                  \"' and context: '\" + context.getContext() + \"' with correlation: '\" + context.getCorrelationId() + \"'\" + userFragment);","}","","@Override","public void onScriptOutput(String output, @NonNull ScriptEventContext context) {","    String userFragment = context.getUser() == null ? \" (no user)\" : \" for user: '\" + context.getUser() + \"'\";","    LOGGER.log(Level.FINER, LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.FINEST) ? new Exception() : null,","            () -> \"Script output: '\" + output + \"' in feature: '\" + context.getFeature() + \"' and context: '\" + context.getContext() +","                  \"' with correlation: '\" + context.getCorrelationId() + \"'\" + userFragment);","}","```","","For other classes that use `fireScriptExecution` and `fireScriptOutput`, you would construct a `ScriptEventContext` object and pass it in. Here is an example for `GroovyCommand`:","","```java","ScriptEventContext context = new ScriptEventContext(GroovyCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, context);","```","","Make sure to update all other occurrences where `feature`, `context`, `correlationId`, and `user` are used together to use the new `ScriptEventContext` class.","","By doing so, you not only reduce the number of parameters passed around but also enhance the readability and maintainability of the code."],["After analyzing the provided code snippets, a data clump is identified in the parameters `Object feature`, `Object context`, and `String correlationId`. Additionally, `User user` is often included with these parameters, presenting a pattern where refactoring would improve the code structure. To refactor this data clump, we'll create a new class named `ScriptEventDetails` and use it to encapsulate these fields.","","First, let's create the new class `ScriptEventDetails`.","","```java","import hudson.model.User;","import javax.annotation.CheckForNull;","import javax.annotation.Nonnull;","","public class ScriptEventDetails {","    @Nonnull","    private final Object feature;","    @CheckForNull","    private final Object context;","    @Nonnull","    private final String correlationId;","    @CheckForNull","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventDetails(@Nonnull Object feature, @CheckForNull Object context, @Nonnull String correlationId, @CheckForNull User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    @Nonnull","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    @CheckForNull","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    @Nonnull","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    @CheckForNull","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, let's refactor the methods of `ScriptListener` and other related usages in the various classes to use `ScriptEventDetails`.","","In `ScriptListener`, we modify the method signatures:","","```java","// We add imports if they are not present","import javax.annotation.CheckForNull;","import javax.annotation.Nonnull;","","public interface ScriptListener {","    default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @Nonnull ScriptEventDetails eventDetails) {","    }","","    default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @Nonnull ScriptEventDetails eventDetails) {","    }","","    static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @Nonnull ScriptEventDetails eventDetails) {","        Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, eventDetails));","    }","","    static void fireScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @Nonnull ScriptEventDetails eventDetails) {","        Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptOutput(output, eventDetails));","    }","}","```","","And for `DefaultScriptListener`, we adjust the overridden methods:","","```java","@Override","public void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails eventDetails) {","    String userFragment = eventDetails.getUser() == null ? \" (no user)\" : \" by user: '\" + eventDetails.getUser() + \"'\";","    LOGGER.log(Level.FINE, LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.FINEST) ? new Exception() : null,","            () -> \"Execution of script: '\" + script + \"' with binding: '\" + stringifyBinding(binding) + \"' in feature: '\" + eventDetails.getFeature() + \"' and context: '\" + eventDetails.getContext() + \"' with correlation: '\" + eventDetails.getCorrelationId() + \"'\" + userFragment);","}","","@Override","public void onScriptOutput(String output, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails eventDetails) {","    String userFragment = eventDetails.getUser() == null ? \" (no user)\" : \" for user: '\" + eventDetails.getUser() + \"'\";","    LOGGER.log(Level.FINER, LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.FINEST) ? new Exception() : null,","            () -> \"Script output: '\" + output + \"' in feature: '\" + eventDetails.getFeature() + \"' and context: '\" + eventDetails.getContext() + \"' with correlation: '\" + eventDetails.getCorrelationId() + \"'\" + userFragment);","}","```","","In the `GroovyCommand`, `GroovyshCommand`, `RemotingDiagnostics`, and `GroovyHookScript` classes, where `fireScriptExecution` and `fireScriptOutput` methods are called, we need to create an instance of `ScriptEventDetails` and pass it as an argument to the modified methods.","","For example, in `GroovyCommand`:","","```java","ScriptEventDetails eventDetails = new ScriptEventDetails(GroovyCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, eventDetails);","```","","Apply this approach to all instances where `fireScriptExecution` and `fireScriptOutput` are called, replacing the individual parameters with instances of `ScriptEventDetails`.","","Note: For classes like `ListenerWriter` and the anonymous `OutputStream` subclass that also include these fields, similar refactoring to use `ScriptEventDetails` should be applied. For brevity, I have not listed the changes for each class, but the same principles apply."],["To refactor the data clumps present in the provided code snippets, we need to identify a data clump according to the given definition and then replace the clumped data with a single object of an extracted class.","","From the available code snippets, we can identify that the `feature`, `context`, `correlationId`, and `user` parameters appear together in several methods which indicate a data clump according to the definition. To refactor this, we will introduce a new class, `ScriptEventDetails`, to encapsulate these fields.","","Here is the content of the extracted class:","","```java","public class ScriptEventDetails {","    @NonNull","    private final Object feature;","    @CheckForNull","    private final Object context;","    @NonNull","    private final String correlationId;","    @CheckForNull","    private final

User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, let's update the method signatures and usages accordingly:","","Note: The following refactored code snippets provide the method signatures and relevant parts of the methods only, not the complete implementations.","","```java","// Update to ScriptListener.java","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script,
