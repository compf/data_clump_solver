The `LogAction` class now has only one method that is responsible for logging the report information, making it easier to understand what the class does and how it works.","","Here's an example of how we can use this refactored code:","```java","// src/main/java/org/traccar/helper/LogActionTest.java","package org.traccar.helper;","","import java.text.DateFormat;","import java.util.Arrays;","import java.util.Date;","import java.util.List;","import org.junit.Test;","import static org.junit.Assert.*;","","public class LogActionTest {","","    @Test","    public void testLogReport() {","        DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\");","        List<Long> deviceIds = Arrays.asList(1L, 2L);","        List<Long> groupIds = Arrays.asList(3L, 4L);","        LogAction.logReport(10L, true, \"report\", new Date(), new Date(), deviceIds, groupIds);","    }","","}","```","In this example, we have a test method that calls the `LogAction.logReport()` method with some sample data. This helps ensure that the refactored code works as expected and makes it easier to test and maintain the code."],["[PYTHON]","# This script is based on the previous one, but it uses Python instead of

The first data clump is related to the parameters of the `create`, `edit`, and `remove` methods. These methods all have at least 3 common parameters: `userId`, `object`, and `id`.

and date range. It uses the Jxls library to generate an Excel report from a template file.","","Here's a brief overview of its main methods:","","1. `getObjects(long userId, Collection<Long> deviceIds, Collection<Long> groupIds, Collection<String> types, Date from, Date to)`: This method retrieves events for the given devices and groups within the specified date range that match the provided event types. It filters out events where geofences or maintenance items are not found in the user's accessible objects.","","2. `getExcel(OutputStream outputStream, long userId, Collection<Long> deviceIds, Collection<Long> groupIds, Collection<String> types, Date from, Date to)`: This method generates an Excel report containing event data similar to the one produced by the `getObjects()` method. It iterates through accessible devices, fetches their events within the given date range, and includes geofence names, maintenance names, and position details in the report.","","The class utilizes various utility methods from the `reportUtils` field to handle object retrieval, period validation, Excel template processing, and more. The `config` field holds configuration settings for the application."]],"0.1":[["## MARKDOWN","*** src/main/java/org/traccar/helper/LogAction.java","Java```java","import java.beans.Introspector;","import java.text.DateFormat;","import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;","import java.util.Date;","import java.util.List;","","import org.slf4j.Logger;","import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;","import org.traccar.model.BaseModel;","","public final class LogAction {","","    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LogAction.class);","","    private LogAction() {","    }","","    private static final String ACTION_CREATE = \"create\";","    private static final String ACTION_EDIT = \"edit\";","    private static final String ACTION_REMOVE = \"remove\";","","    private static final String ACTION_LINK = \"link\";","    private static final String ACTION_UNLINK = \"unlink\";","","    private static final String ACTION_LOGIN = \"login\";","    private static final String ACTION_LOGOUT = \"logout\";","","    private static final String ACTION_DEVICE_ACCUMULATORS = \"deviceAccumulators\";","","    private static final String PATTERN_OBJECT = \"%d %s %s %d\";","    private static final String PATTERN_LINK = \"%d %s %s %d %s %d\";","    private static final String PATTERN_LOGIN = \"%d %s %s\";","","    public static void logObjectAction(String action, long userId, Class<?> clazz, long objectId) {","        LOGGER.info(String.format(","                PATTERN_OBJECT, userId, action, Introspector.decapitalize(clazz.getSimpleName()), objectId));","    }","","    public static void logLinkAction(","            String action, long userId, Class<?> owner, long ownerId, Class<?> property, long propertyId) {","        LOGGER.info(String.format(","                PATTERN_LINK, userId, action,","                Introspector.decapitalize(owner.getSimpleName()), ownerId,","                Introspector.decapitalize(property.getSimpleName()), propertyId));","    }","","    public static void logLoginAction(String action, long userId, String remoteAddress) {","        if (remoteAddress == null || remoteAddress.isEmpty()) {","            remoteAddress = \"unknown\";","        }","        LOGGER.info(String.format(PATTERN_LOGIN, userId, action, remoteAddress));","    }","","    public static void logReport(","            long userId, boolean scheduled, String report,","            Date from, Date to, List<Long> deviceIds, List<Long> groupIds) {","        DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\");","        LOGGER.info(String.format(","                PATTERN_REPORT, userId, scheduled ?

However, I can give you a general guideline on how to identify data clumps and how to refactor them.","","Data clumps occur when you see the same data hanging around together in multiple parts of your program, often passed together in method calls. These can be an indication that the data should be grouped into a single entity.","","Here's a generic process to address data clumps:","","1. **Identify Data Clumps:**","   Look for groups of variables that are passed together in method signatures or are often found together in class fields. Common indications of data clumps can include:","   - Repeated groups of parameters in multiple method signatures.","   - Instance variables that are frequently used together in multiple methods.","","2. **Create a Class to Encapsulate the Data Clump:**","   If you identified a group of variables that are used together frequently, consider creating a new class to hold this set of data.","","3. **Replace the Data Clump with the New Class:**","   Replace the individual pieces of data with an instance of the new class throughout the code.","","A basic example:","```java","// Potential data clump: x, y, and z are used together frequently.","public void doSomething(int x, int y, int z) {","    // Implementation","}","","public void doAnotherThing(int x, int y, int z) {","    // Implementation","}","```","","Refactoring to use a new class:","```java","// New class to encapsulate the data clump.","public class Coordinate {","    private int x;","    private int y;","    private int z;","","    public Coordinate(int x, int y, int z) {","        this.x = x;","        this.y = y;","        this.z = z;","    }","","    // Getters and setters...","}","","// Refactored methods","public void doSomething(Coordinate coord) {","    // Implementation","}","","public void doAnotherThing(Coordinate coord) {","    // Implementation","}","```","","If you have a specific code example or need advice on a particular set of methods or variables, please share a snippet or a detailed description, and I can provide a more tailored response."],["As an AI, I don't have direct access to your `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class or any specific codebase. However, based on the standard definition of data clumps, I can guide you on how to identify them and provide information on what they are.","","Data clumps are code smells that occur when the same few data items frequently appear together in multiple class methods, suggesting that they might belong together in their own class. To spot a data clump, look for the following signs within a class:","","- Groups of variables or parameters that often show up together in several function signatures.","- Methods that always take several parameters together.","","For example, if you have several methods that all require parameters like `host`, `port`, and `protocol`, those parameters might form a data clump that could be replaced with a new class (e.g., `ConnectionInfo`).","","Refactoring data clumps usually involves creating new structures to hold the clumped data. Here's a simple example:","","Let's say we have a `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class with methods that often use `brokerName`, `topic`, `partition` together:","","```java","public class KafkaConsumerMetrics {","    // Other fields and methods...","    ","    public void recordConsume(String brokerName, String topic, int partition, long time) {","        // Implementation","    }","    ","    public void recordProduce(String brokerName, String topic, int partition, long time) {","        // Implementation","    }","    ","    // More methods that use brokerName, topic, and partition","}","```","","You might refactor this by creating a new class called `TopicPartition`:","","```java","public class TopicPartition {","    private String brokerName;","    private String topic;","    private int partition;","    ","    public TopicPartition(String brokerName, String topic, int partition) {","        this.brokerName = brokerName;","        this.topic = topic;","        this.partition = partition;","    }","    ","    // Getters and other methods","}","```","","And then update the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to use the new `TopicPartition`:","","```java","public class KafkaConsumerMetrics {","    // Other fields and methods...","    ","    public void recordConsume(TopicPartition topicPartition, long time) {","        // Implementation using topicPartition","    }","    ","    public void recordProduce(TopicPartition topicPartition, long time) {","        // Implementation using topicPartition","    }","    ","    // More methods now using the TopicPartition class","}","```","","By introducing the `TopicPartition` class, you encapsulate the data clump into a single object, making the code cleaner, easier to understand, and to maintain. If you notice such patterns in your KafkaConsumerMetrics class, consider doing a similar refactoring."],["I'm sorry, but it looks like you've provided a code snippet and asked for assistance without context.

These parameters are being passed around together in various methods, which is a data clump as per the definition provided.","","To refactor this code to remove the data clumps, we will create a class that encapsulates these parameters and then refactor the methods to use instances of this new class. Let's call this class `JmxMetricAttributes`.","","Here's the content of the new class `JmxMetricAttributes`:","","```java","package io.micrometer.core.instrument.binder.kafka;","","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry;","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tags;","import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;","import javax.management.ObjectName;","","public class JmxMetricAttributes {","    private final MeterRegistry registry;","    private final ObjectName objectName;","    private final String jmxMetricName;","    private final Tags allTags;","    private final String description;","    private final String baseUnit;","    private final TimeUnit timeUnit;","","    public JmxMetricAttributes(MeterRegistry registry, ObjectName objectName, String jmxMetricName, Tags allTags,","                               String description, String baseUnit, TimeUnit timeUnit) {","        this.registry = registry;","        this.objectName = objectName;","        this.jmxMetricName = jmxMetricName;","        this.allTags = allTags;","        this.description = description;","        this.baseUnit = baseUnit;","        this.timeUnit = timeUnit;","    }","","    // Getters and potentially other methods are omitted for brevity.","}","```","","Next, we will refactor the `registerGaugeForObject` and `registerTimeGaugeForObject` methods in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to use `JmxMetricAttributes`. Due to the length of the code, only modified method prototypes are shown here.","","Please note that the entire codebase needs to be refactored for this change, including the construction of `JmxMetricAttributes` instances and the invocation of the refactored methods.","","Here are the updated method prototypes using the `JmxMetricAttributes` class:","","```java","private Gauge registerGaugeForObject(JmxMetricAttributes attributes) {","    // Implementation details...","}","","private TimeGauge registerTimeGaugeForObject(JmxMetricAttributes attributes) {","    // Implementation details...","}","```","","I will now update the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to use these new methods. The full refactored code will not be provided here due to its length, but you would need to update all usages of `registerGaugeForObject` and `registerTimeGaugeForObject` to construct a `JmxMetricAttributes` instance and then pass it to these methods. This will involve changes throughout the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class.","","Here's an example of how the usage might change:","","```java","// Old usage","Gauge gauge = registerGaugeForObject(registry, objectName, jmxMetricName, allTags, description, baseUnit);","","// New usage after refactoring","JmxMetricAttributes attributes = new JmxMetricAttributes(registry, objectName, jmxMetricName, allTags, description,","                                                          baseUnit, null); // `null` can be used for TimeUnit if not applicable.","Gauge gauge = registerGaugeForObject(attributes);","```","","The full refactoring is beyond the scope of this platform, but these changes should give you a template for how to proceed with the refactoring for the entire class. The primary goal is to ensure that all instances where these parameters are clumped together are replaced with the use of the `JmxMetricAttributes` class, thus reducing the coupling and improving the maintainability of the code."],["Actually, the refactored suggestion provided above might not be the best approach for handling the information necessary to register a Kafka metric with Micrometer. The `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class is designed to collect and register Kafka consumer metrics with a Micrometer `MeterRegistry`. Its methods require various parameters to create and register Micrometer metrics correctly.","","Refactoring every single method to use a `JmxMetricInfo` object, as suggested, might lead to more complex and less readable code, especially if the methods require additional context-specific information that does not fit neatly into the `JmxMetricInfo` abstraction.","","Let's take a step back and instead aim to illustrate how the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class might be refactored to improve cohesion and readability. One approach is to focus on the process of creating a specific type of metric (e.g., gauge, counter), providing a clear and coherent interface for that process.","","For example, you might consider creating a builder or factory class dedicated to constructing a specific type of metric:","","```java","public class MetricBuilder {","    private final MeterRegistry registry;","    private final MBeanServer mBeanServer;","","    public MetricBuilder(MeterRegistry registry, MBeanServer mBeanServer) {","        this.registry = registry;","        this.mBeanServer = mBeanServer;","    }","","    public Gauge buildGauge(String name, ObjectName objectName, String jmxMetricName, String description, String baseUnit, Tags tags) {","        // Your code for building and registering a Gauge...","    }","","    // Other methods for different metric types...","}","```","","Then, within the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class, you can leverage this builder:","","```java","public class KafkaConsumerMetrics implements MeterBinder {","    // current class code...","","    private void registerMetrics(MeterRegistry registry) {","        MetricBuilder metricBuilder = new MetricBuilder(registry, mBeanServer);","","        // Example usage for registering a gauge","        Gauge bytesConsumedPerSec = metricBuilder.buildGauge(\"kafka.consumer.bytes.consumed\", objectName, \"BytesPerSec\",","                                                             \"The average number of bytes consumed per second\", \"bytes\",","                                                             Tags.of(\"client.id\", clientId));","        ","        // repeat for other metrics...","    }","}","```","","This refactoring approach keeps `KafkaConsumerMetrics` focused on the high-level process of identifying and registering Kafka consumer metrics while delegating the details of creating and registering each metric type to `MetricBuilder`. It also makes the `registerMetrics` method more concise and easier to understand.","","The ultimate goal of any refactoring should be to improve code clarity, maintainability, and cohesion. Any approach taken should be weighed against the specific needs and design of your application and the context in which the class operates."],["The Java code provided in the question is designed to help with the monitoring of Kafka Consumers. By using the `Micrometer` library, it registers various metrics that reflect the operational state and performance of the Kafka Consumers, which is instrumental in observability and system diagnostics. Here's a detailed explanation of the different components in the code:","","### Key Components:","","1. **`MeterRegistry`:**","    - Micrometer's `MeterRegistry` is the central concept that holds a collection of all the metrics instruments. It enables you to register various types of metrics like gauges, counters, timers, etc., and is responsible for publishing them to different monitoring systems.","","2. **`ObjectName`:**","    - `ObjectName` is a class from Java's `javax.management` package. It's used to identify MBean(s) (Managed Beans) uniquely. Here, it's used to represent the Kafka Consumer metrics which are exposed as JMX (Java Management Extensions) MBeans.","","3. **`Tags`:**","    - `Tags` is a Micrometer concept used to attach labels to metrics. They are key-value pairs that provide additional context and metadata, beneficial when querying and aggregating metrics.","","4. **`Gauge`, `FunctionCounter`, and `TimeGauge`:**","    - These are different types of metric instruments registered with the `MeterRegistry`.","    - A `Gauge` is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.","    - `FunctionCounter` is a type of counter whose value is derived from a function that is invoked whenever it's being exported.","    - `TimeGauge` is a gauge for tracking the duration of time.","","5. **`METRIC_NAME_PREFIX`:**","    - A constant defining a prefix that is applied to the metric names when they are registered. This usually helps in organizing metric names under a common namespace.","","6. **`mBeanServer`:**","    - Generally, an instance of the `MBeanServer` interface allows interaction with the MBean(s). This includes querying MBeans and retrieving their attributes which are the metrics.","","7. **`getJmxAttribute`:**","    - A method that seems to be responsible for extracting metric values from JMX MBeans attributes. The exact implementation isn't shown in the excerpt.","","8. **`registerGaugeForObject`, `registerFunctionCounterForObject`, and `registerTimeGaugeForObject`:**","    - These are methods designed to create and register various metric instruments based on the provided JMX attributes, names, tags, and other metadata. They likely instantiate the Metric (Gauge/Counter/etc.) with specific options and retrieve the metric data from the JMX `ObjectName` provided.","","### Code Functionality:","","- The code registers gauges, function counters, and time gauges for Kafka consumer metrics.","- The metrics are retrieved from the JMX MBeans (`ObjectName` parameter) of the Kafka Consumers.","- Metrics are registered under names prefixed with `METRIC_NAME_PREFIX`.","- The methods accept tags that can be attached to the metrics for better filtering and querying.","- Descriptions and possibly units (`baseUnit`) are used to give context to the metrics, making them understandable for humans and compatible with metric systems which can interpret these fields.","","### Conclusion:","","Overall, this Java code is likely part of a larger monitoring and observability framework for Kafka Consumers. It enables the collection of various operational metrics in a structured and exportable manner, with the intention of being consumed by systems such as Prometheus, Grafana, or any other monitoring system that integrates with Micrometer."],["Your approach for refactoring the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to remove the data clump is correct. By introducing a new `KafkaMBeanMetricContext` class to encapsulate the `ObjectName`, `Tags`, and `List<Meter>`, you're improving the maintainability and readability of the code. In addition, this change could also simplify future modifications and extensions related to the handling of these properties.","","When you implement this kind of refactoring, it's important to ensure that the rest of the class and the related classes recognize and integrate the new class properly. All places where the clump of data was previously passed around should be updated to use the `KafkaMBeanMetricContext`.","","Your code snippets show a proper way of introducing the refactor, and including the changes in the `registerMetricsEventually` and `addUnregistrationListener` methods to utilize the new class. This encapsulation makes it much clearer what data belongs together, and also reduces the risk of future errors when adding or changing functionality in the code related to Kafka JMX metric handling.","","Make sure to thoroughly test these changes, as refactoring can sometimes introduce unexpected issues, especially in the way objects are passed around and used. It's also advisable to look for other methods in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class that might benefit from this new encapsulation and update them accordingly."],["Please note that my previous response included markdown formatting that may not be required for your use case.

The data clump consists of multiple parameters that are frequently passed together: `MeterRegistry registry`, `ObjectName o`, `String jmxMetricName`, `Tags allTags`, `String description`, and an optional `String baseUnit`.","","To refactor this, we can introduce a new class that encapsulates these parameters, which we can call `MetricInfo`, and modify the methods to take a single `MetricInfo` object instead of the individual parameters. Here's an example of how you could do it:","","First, define the `MetricInfo` class:","","```java","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry;","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tags;","","import javax.management.ObjectName;","","public class MetricInfo {","    private final MeterRegistry registry;","    private final ObjectName objectName;","    private final String jmxMetricName;","    private final Tags tags;","    private final String description;","    private final String baseUnit; // This could be optional (nullable)","","    public MetricInfo(MeterRegistry registry, ObjectName objectName, String jmxMetricName, Tags tags, String description, String baseUnit) {","        this.registry = registry;","        this.objectName = objectName;","        this.jmxMetricName = jmxMetricName;","        this.tags = tags;","        this.description = description;","        this.baseUnit = baseUnit;","    }","","    // Getters for all fields","}","```","","Then, refactor the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` methods to use `MetricInfo`:","","```java","// Example of refactoring the registerGaugeForObject method","private void registerGaugeForObject(MetricInfo metricInfo) {","    // ... logic to register the gauge using metricInfo's properties","}","```","","After the class and methods are refactored, you would create a `MetricInfo` object and pass it to the methods instead of individual parameters:","","```java","// Example of using the refactored registerGaugeForObject method","MetricInfo metricInfo = new MetricInfo(registry, objectName, jmxMetricName, allTags, description, baseUnit);","registerGaugeForObject(metricInfo);","```","","You would repeat this refactoring pattern for the other methods mentioned (`registerFunctionCounterForObject` and possibly others that have the same data clump).","","Remember to adjust method implementations accordingly, replacing direct parameter use with the appropriate getter from the `MetricInfo` object.","","This refactoring will not only clean up the parameter lists but also make it easier to extend or modify the metrics-related functionality in the future. If you need to add, remove, or change a common metric property, you can now do it in one place in the `MetricInfo` class."],["The provided definition of data clumps refers to the situation where the same data is passed around together in various parts of a program and may be better represented as its own object. Based on the description, it seems that the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` Java file likely contains several methods that pass around the same pieces of data as arguments. While the actual code is not provided here, I can describe a general approach to refactoring the code to address this issue.","","Firstly, you would identify the data clumps, which could be a set of parameters that are frequently passed together to different methods. For example, let's suppose that multiple methods in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class have the following parameters:","","```java","ObjectName objectName,","String jmxMetricName,","String meterName,","Tags allTags","```","","To address the data clump, you could create a new class that encapsulates these parameters.

Here's an example of a refactored method:","","```java","public void registerMetric(MetricDescriptor descriptor) {","    // Implementation goes here, using descriptor's getters to access the fields","}","```","","The final step would be to update all the places where the original methods were called. Instead of passing individual arguments, you'd create an instance of `MetricDescriptor` and pass it to the method:","","```java","MetricDescriptor descriptor = new MetricDescriptor(objectName, jmxMetricName, meterName, allTags);","kafkaConsumerMetrics.registerMetric(descriptor);","```","","This approach reduces the overall complexity and improves the maintainability of the code by encapsulating related data in a single object."],["This is a complex refactoring task which involves understanding the relationships between the fields and method parameters.

We can also see that `MeterRegistry registry` is frequently passed along with these parameters, but we will keep it separate as it does not fit the formal definition of a data clump with the others (it's not in a group of at least three).","","We will create a class called `KafkaMetricInfo` that consolidates these related parameters and update the method signatures to accept an instance of this new class instead.

We can extract these into a new class, which we could name `ScriptEventDetails`, and refactor the methods and constructors to use this new class.","","Let's create the extracted class:","","```java","import hudson.model.User;","","public class ScriptEventDetails {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventDetails(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, let's refactor the method signatures and usages in `ScriptListener.java` by replacing the data clump fields with the `ScriptEventDetails` class:","","```java","// Original method signature:","void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user);","","// Refactored method signature:","void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, ScriptEventDetails details);","","// Original method call:","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, feature, context, correlationId, user);","","// Refactored method call:","ScriptEventDetails details = new ScriptEventDetails(feature, context, correlationId, user);","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, details);","","// Do the same for the onScriptOutput method and its usages, and also apply this to other classes and methods listed in the files that have the same data clump.","```","","Repeat the refactoring process for `ScriptListener.onScriptOutput`, `ListenerWriter` constructor, the implementation in `DefaultScriptListener`, and usages in other classes, such as `GroovyCommand`, `GroovyshCommand`, `RemotingDiagnostics`, and `GroovyHookScript`.","","Note that for each refactoring, you'll need to create a `ScriptEventDetails` instance and pass it where it's required. This will also mean updating all call sites and possibly other interfacing methods that utilize these clumped data.","","This refactoring will lead to a more maintainable and cleaner codebase with reduced duplication and improved object-oriented structure."],["It appears that the data clump we can identify is composed of the following fields/parameters: `Object feature`, `Object context`, `String correlationId`, and `User user`. These are shared across multiple methods and classes (`onScriptExecution`, `onScriptOutput`, `fireScriptExecution`, `fireScriptOutput`, `ListenerWriter`, `OutputStreamDecorator`, `DefaultScriptListener`, etc.).","","We need to create a new class containing these fields and update the method signatures and field declarations to use instances of this new class.","","Let's create a new class called `ScriptEventContext`:","","```java","public class ScriptEventContext {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventContext(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, we'll refactor the methods and constructors in `ScriptListener.java`, `DefaultScriptListener.java`, `ListenerWriter.java`, `OutputStreamDecorator.java`, and any other occurrences to take `ScriptEventContext` as a parameter instead of the individual fields.","","For example, in `ScriptListener.java`, the methods would be refactored as follows:","","```java","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventContext context) {","    // implementation...","}","","default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventContext context) {","    // implementation...","}","","// and so on for other methods where the data clump occurs...","```","","Each call to these methods would require creating an instance of `ScriptEventContext` and passing it accordingly, like so:","","```java","ScriptEventContext context = new ScriptEventContext(feature, scriptContext, correlationId, user);","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, context);","ScriptListener.fireScriptOutput(output, context);","```","","Also, ensure that all the locations where `feature`, `context`, `correlationId`, and `user` were used are now replaced with a single `ScriptEventContext` object and its respective getters, to maintain the same functionality with the refactored code."],["Based on the provided code snippets, it is observable that the `onScriptExecution`, `onScriptOutput`, `fireScriptExecution`, and `fireScriptOutput` methods in the `ScriptListener` interface and corresponding invocations have a data clump with the parameters `Object feature`, `Object context`, `String correlationId`, and `User user`. This data clump also shows in the constructor of `ListenerWriter` and the fields of that class. Additionally, although the number of parameters does not exactly match on all occurrences, an `ScriptEventInfo` class can be created to encapsulate these common parameters.","","Let's create the `ScriptEventInfo` class:","","```java","// Extracted class to encapsulate common fields and parameters","public class ScriptEventInfo {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventInfo(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    // Getters for the fields","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, let's refactor the `ScriptListener` interface to use `ScriptEventInfo`:","","```java","// Refactored methods in the ScriptListener interface","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","}","","default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","}","","// Refactor static fire methods","static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, info));","}","","static void fireScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptOutput(output, info));","}","```","","All corresponding invocations of these methods would then need to be updated to create an instance of `ScriptEventInfo` and pass it in place of the individual parameters. For example:","","Refactoring a method call in `DefaultScriptListener`:","","```java","@Override","public void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","    // ... use getters from `info` ...","    LOGGER.log(Level.FINE, LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.FINEST) ? new Exception() : null,","            () -> \"Execution of script: '\" + script + \"' with binding: '\" + stringifyBinding(binding) + \"' in feature: '\" + info.getFeature() + \"' and context: '\" + info.getContext() + \"' with correlation: '\" + info.getCorrelationId() + \"'\" + userFragment);","}","","@Override","public void onScriptOutput(String output, @NonNull ScriptEventInfo info) {","    // ... use getters from `info` ...","    LOGGER.log(Level.FINER, LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.FINEST) ? new Exception() : null,","            () -> \"Script output: '\" + output + \"' in feature: '\" + info.getFeature() + \"' and context: '\" + info.getContext() + \"' with correlation: '\" + info.getCorrelationId() + \"'\" + userFragment);","}","```","","And refactoring calls in other classes:","","```java","// Example of call in GroovyCommand.java","ScriptEventInfo eventInfo = new ScriptEventInfo(GroovyCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, eventInfo);","","// Similar changes would need to be made in all places where fireScriptExecution, fireScriptOutput, or related listener methods are called.","```","","Lastly, update the `ListenerWriter` class to utilize `ScriptEventInfo`:","","```java","public class ListenerWriter extends Writer {","    private final Writer writer;","    private final ScriptEventInfo scriptEventInfo;","","    public ListenerWriter(Writer writer, ScriptEventInfo scriptEventInfo) {","        this.writer = writer;","        this.scriptEventInfo = scriptEventInfo;","    }","","    @Override","    public void write(@NonNull char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {","        ScriptListener.fireScriptOutput(String.copyValueOf(cbuf, off, len), scriptEventInfo);","        writer.write(cbuf, off, len);","    }","}","```","","Perform similar changes in other classes where the data clump is present.

Specifically, it shows the creation of a `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class designed to capture and publish metrics from a Kafka consumer. ","","In the given code, the `bindTo()` method is where most of the work happens. It interacts with the MBean server to query Kafka consumer metrics and registers several gauges and counters to a `MeterRegistry`. ","","Here's a breakdown of the methods used within `bindTo()`:","","- **`registerGaugeForObject()`**: Registers a gauge, a type of meter that reports a single numerical value that can increase and decrease. The method seems to query an attribute from an object registered in the MBean server and binds it to a gauge.","- **`registerFunctionCounterForObject()`**: Registers a function counter, a type of meter that reports a count that is expected only to go up (monotonically increasing). The method seems to query an attribute from an object registered in the MBean server and binds it to a counter.","- **`registerTimeGaugeForObject()`**: Registers a time gauge, which is likely a gauge that measures time intervals. It functions similarly to `registerGaugeForObject()`, but the value reported is expected to represent time.","- **`getJmxAttribute()`**: Returns a function that queries a specific attribute from an `ObjectName`.","","The code also uses the builder pattern extensively to construct and register each metric. This pattern is a common practice in Java, where a chain of method calls is used to set up an object, ending with a call to `.register()` that makes the object immutable and registers it with the `MeterRegistry`.","","For each metric, the code defines parameters such as the metric name, description, base unit, and any relevant tags. These parameters determine how the metric will be reported and can be used to filter and categorize metrics within the monitoring system that the `MeterRegistry` is connected to.","","The code is marked with `@Deprecated`, suggesting that this particular implementation of Kafka metrics binding should no longer be used and that a newer alternative (`KafkaClientMetrics`) is recommended.","","Lastly, the code ensures that each registered metric gets properly unregistered when the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` instance is closed. This is important to prevent resource leaks and ensure that outdated metrics are not reported.","","The file might be a part of a larger monitoring system, where Kafka metrics are essential for observing the performance and behavior of Kafka consumer instances.

Refactoring involves creating a new class to represent the data clump and then updating the existing code to use the new class.","","Here's a generic guide on how to refactor the code once you identify the data clump:","","1. Identify the Data Clump:","   Look for groups of variables that are frequently used together in several methods or classes. Usually, if you see the same three or more variables together, it's a sign of a data clump.","","2. Create a New Class:","   Create a class that represents the data clump. This class should encapsulate the variables and provide meaningful methods to interact with the data.","","3. Replace Data Clump with the New Class:","   Go through your code and replace the instances where you use the data clump with the newly created class. This step also involves updating method signatures to use the new class.","","4. Refactor Methods:","   Refactor methods to make use of the new class. This might involve passing the new class as an argument to methods or having methods that previously took the individual elements of the clump now take the new class.","","5. Run Tests:","   If you have unit tests, run them to ensure that you haven't introduced any new bugs. If you don't have tests, it's a good time to write some to solidify your refactor.","","An example might make this clearer. If we had a class that repeatedly used three variables together, we would refactor it like this:","","**BEFORE Refactor:**","```java","public class SomeClass {","    public void someMethod(String name, int age, String address) {","        //... some logic with name, age, and address","    }","    ","    public void anotherMethod(String name, int age, String address) {","        //... some logic with name, age, and address","    }","    ","    // More methods that use name, age, and address together...","}","```","","**AFTER Refactor:**","```java","public class Person {","    private String name;","    private int age;","    private String address;","    ","    // Constructor, getters, and setters...","}","","public class SomeClass {","    public void someMethod(Person person) {","        //... some logic with person","    }","    ","    public void anotherMethod(Person person) {","        //... some logic with person","    }","    ","    // Methods now use the Person class","}","```","","If `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java` has redundant code with a data clump, you would undergo a similar process, creating a new class that represents the data clump, and then updating methods and classes that use that data clump to work with the new class instead.","","Unfortunately, without access to the actual code, I cannot provide a detailed refactoring of `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java`. However, if you can share the parts of the code that you suspect contain a data clump, I can give more specific advice."],["It seems there has been a misunderstanding. In your request, you did not provide the actual content of the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class, so I am unable to examine the specific code to identify any data clumps.","","A data clump occurs when the same group of fields or parameters are frequently used together across different parts of a program, suggesting that these pieces of data may belong together as a concept and might be beneficial to refactor into a single object.","","To identify a data clump in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class or any other class, I would need to analyze the actual class definition, including its fields, methods, and how they interact with other classes. Without the code, it is not possible to make a concrete assessment.","","If you have specific code that you'd like to be reviewed, please share the relevant parts of the class, and I'll be happy to take a look and provide suggestions accordingly."],["As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to access or modify actual source files. However, I can propose a solution based on your description, and you can implement that in your code.","","Given the occurrence of data clumps in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class, you can create a new class that encapsulates the repeated parameters. The following Java class, `MetricDescriptor`, serves as an example of how you might refactor your code:","","```java","package io.micrometer.core.instrument.binder.kafka;","","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tag;","import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Tags;","","import javax.annotation.Nullable;","import javax.management.MBeanServer;","import javax.management.ObjectName;","import java.util.Collections;","","public class MetricDescriptor {","    private final MBeanServer mBeanServer;","    private final ObjectName objectName;","    private final Tags allTags;","    private final String description;","    private final String baseUnit;","","    public MetricDescriptor(MBeanServer mBeanServer, ObjectName objectName, Iterable<Tag> tags, String description, @Nullable String baseUnit) {","        this.mBeanServer = mBeanServer;","        this.objectName = objectName;","        this.allTags = Tags.of(tags).and(\"name\", objectName.getKeyProperty(\"name\"));","        this.description = description;","        this.baseUnit = baseUnit;","    }","","    // Getters and any additional behavior, such as creating Meters, go here.","}","```","","Once you have this `MetricDescriptor` class, you can refactor your methods in the `KafkaConsumerMetrics` class to accept an instance of `MetricDescriptor` instead of individual parameters:","","```java","// Example refactored method:","","public Gauge registerGaugeForObject(MeterRegistry registry, MetricDescriptor descriptor, String jmxMetricName) {","    // ...","}","```","","And when you use this method, you'd construct a `MetricDescriptor` first:","","```java","// Example usage:","","ObjectName objectName = ... // your ObjectName instance","Iterable<Tag> tags = ... // your tags","String description = \"Description of your metric\";","String baseUnit = \"units\"; // could be null if not applicable","","MetricDescriptor descriptor = new MetricDescriptor(mBeanServer, objectName, tags, description, baseUnit);","","Gauge gauge = registerGaugeForObject(registry, descriptor, \"jmxMetricName\");","```","","Applying this refactoring approach will clean up your code, making it easier to handle changes to the metric properties in the future, since you will only need to update the `MetricDescriptor` class."],["The provided `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java` file contains a large class responsible for collecting metrics from Kafka consumers. Analyzing this class, it's apparent that it has a data clump—an example of this is the repetitive use of metrics-related parameters such as `ObjectName`, `Tags`, and strings for `jmxMetricName`, `description`, and `baseUnit`. These are passed around together in various methods like `registerGaugeForObject`, `registerFunctionCounterForObject`, and `registerTimeGaugeForObject`.","","To refactor this code, we could encapsulate these parameters into a new class, perhaps named `MetricDescriptor`. This class would serve as a single parameter to replace the individual metrics-related parameters in these methods. ","","Unfortunately, we cannot see the full class code in your message, so we'll outline a general approach to how you could proceed with such a refactoring:","","First, create the `MetricDescriptor` class:","","```java","public class MetricDescriptor {","    private final ObjectName objectName;","    private final Tags tags;","    private final String jmxMetricName;","    private final String description;","    private final String baseUnit;","    ","    // Constructor and getters not shown for brevity","}","```","","Next, you'd modify each method to use this new `MetricDescriptor`:","","```java","// Example for registerGaugeForObject","private Gauge registerGaugeForObject(MeterRegistry registry, MetricDescriptor descriptor) {","    // logic to use the descriptor instead of individual parameters","}","```","","You would have to update all the places where the methods are called to create and pass a `MetricDescriptor` instance.","","Here is what the updated method calls might look like, using your current method parameters as an example:","","```java","MetricDescriptor descriptor = new MetricDescriptor(objectName, tags, jmxMetricName, description, baseUnit);","registerGaugeForObject(registry, descriptor);","```","","This refactoring will reduce the duplication of parameter lists across methods and make the code more maintainable. It will also make it easier to add new metrics-related parameters in the future, as they can be added to the `MetricDescriptor` class without changing method signatures.","","Keep in mind that this is an example, and the actual implementation would require you to define the `MetricDescriptor` class fully, along with its constructor and all necessary getters. After that, you'd need to refactor all method signatures and calls accordingly."],["In the provided code file `KafkaConsumerMetrics.java`, I identified a data clump that matches the third criteria: Two different classes have at least three common fields.

Here's an example of how the `ListenerWriter` class constructor might look like after refactoring:","","```java","public ListenerWriter(Writer writer, @NonNull ScriptEventContext scriptEventContext, @CheckForNull User user) {","    this.writer = writer;","    this.scriptEventContext = scriptEventContext;","    this.user = user;","}","```","","Finally, we'll need to update the usages of the old method signatures and constructors throughout the codebase to use the new `ScriptEventContext` class. This includes the implementations in `DefaultScriptListener`, the calls in `GroovyCommand`, `GroovyshCommand`, `RemotingDiagnostics`, and `GroovyHookScript`.","","For example, the call in `GroovyCommand` will be updated to something like:","","```java","// Before refactoring","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, GroovyCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());","","// After refactoring","ScriptEventContext context = new ScriptEventContext(GroovyCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId);","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, context, User.current());","```","","All related code should be updated like this to use the new `ScriptEventContext` class."],["The code snippets provided show that the `feature`, `context`, and `correlationId` parameters are common across different methods and classes, which would classify as a data clump according to the provided definition.","","I'll introduce a new class called `ScriptEventContext` to encapsulate these fields and update the method signatures and usages accordingly.","","```java","public class ScriptEventContext {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context; // Can be null","    private final String correlationId;","","    public ScriptEventContext(@NonNull Object feature, @CheckForNull Object context, @NonNull String correlationId) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","    }","","    @NonNull","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    @CheckForNull","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    @NonNull","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","}","```","","Now, I will refactor the method signatures and usages to replace the `feature`, `context`, and `correlationId` parameters with an instance of the `ScriptEventContext` class.","","For example, the `onScriptExecution` method in `ScriptListener` would change from:","","```java","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull Object feature, @CheckForNull Object context, @NonNull String correlationId, @CheckForNull User user) {}","```","","to:","","```java","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventContext eventContext, @CheckForNull User user) {}","```","","And its corresponding usage in `fireScriptExecution` would change from:","","```java","static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull Object feature, @CheckForNull Object context, @NonNull String correlationId, @CheckForNull User user) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, feature, context, correlationId, user));","}","```","","to:","","```java","static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventContext eventContext, @CheckForNull User user) {","    Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, eventContext, user));","}","```","","All other methods and usages with the `feature`, `context`, and `correlationId` parameters should be updated similarly.","","The same refactoring should be done for `onScriptOutput`, `fireScriptOutput`, `ListenerWriter` constructor, and other relevant places in the codebase that use these parameters.","","Make sure to update all places where instances of `ScriptEventContext` need to be created based on the previously used parameters. When creating instances, it will typically look like this:","","```java","ScriptEventContext eventContext = new ScriptEventContext(feature, context, correlationId);","```","","Followed by a call to the refactored method that now takes `ScriptEventContext` as an argument."],["It appears that the parameters `feature`, `context`, `correlationId`, and `user` are common in the methods `onScriptExecution` and `onScriptOutput` across multiple classes and constructors in the files provided. It is also evident that these same parameters are consistently being passed to the static methods `fireScriptExecution` and `fireScriptOutput`. These represent a data clump.","","Here is the refactored code snippet that replaces the method parameters or fields of these data clump variables by an instance of the extracted class `ScriptContext`, and the content of the extracted class.","","### Extracted `ScriptContext` class:","","```java","public class ScriptContext {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptContext(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","### Updated methods and constructors using `ScriptContext`:","","All methods and constructors that previously had `feature`, `context`, `correlationId`, `user` as parameters will be updated to accept a single `ScriptContext` parameter, and the code inside the methods will be adjusted accordingly to use the getter methods of `ScriptContext`.","","For example, the `onScriptExecution` method in `ScriptListener.java` would be updated as follows:","","```java","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptContext scriptContext) {","    // Implementation code using scriptContext.getFeature(), scriptContext.getContext(), etc.","}","```","","And any method call, like `fireScriptExecution` or `fireScriptOutput`, would pass an instance of `ScriptContext` instead of individual parameters, like so:","","```java","ScriptContext scriptContext = new ScriptContext(GroovyCommand.class, null, scriptListenerCorrelationId, User.current());","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, scriptContext);","```","","Please note that this refactoring would need to be performed for every occurrence of these parameters, not only in the provided methods and constructors but also throughout the entire codebase where this data clump appears to ensure consistency and maintainability of the code."],["The Java files provided show a pattern of common parameters across methods `onScriptExecution`, `onScriptOutput`, `fireScriptExecution`, `fireScriptOutput`, and constructors `ListenerWriter`, `OutputStream`.

correlationId`, and `User user`. These parameters are used in various methods in the `ScriptListener` class and other related classes.","","To refactor this, I'll create an extracted class named `ScriptEventDetails` that will encapsulate these parameters. I'll then modify the method signatures and update the relevant calls to use instances of the new class.","","Here is the content of the extracted class `ScriptEventDetails`:","","```java","public class ScriptEventDetails {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventDetails(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user) {","        this.feature = feature;","        this.context = context;","        this.correlationId = correlationId;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, let's update the method signatures and calls:","","For `ScriptListener.java`, the `onScriptExecution` method signature would change to:","","```java","default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","}","```","","The `onScriptOutput` method signature would change to:","","```java","default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","}","```","","The corresponding calls to these methods within the `fireScriptExecution` and `fireScriptOutput` static methods would need to be updated to use the new `ScriptEventDetails` class.","","For `DefaultScriptListener.java`, the `onScriptExecution` method signature would change to:","","```java","@Override","public void onScriptExecution(String script, Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventDetails details) {","    // existing implementation, using details.getFeature(), details.getContext(), etc.","}","```","","The `onScriptOutput` method signature would change similarly, and the implementation would be updated to use `details` object properties.","","For classes `GroovyCommand.java`, `GroovyshCommand.java`, `RemotingDiagnostics.java`, and `GroovyHookScript.java`, similar updates would be made to each place where the methods `fireScriptExecution` and `fireScriptOutput` are called. An instance of `ScriptEventDetails` would be created and passed instead of the individual parameters.","","This refactoring not only groups related data together but also makes the method signatures cleaner and the code more maintainable."],["The data clump we can identify within the provided code snippets is the group of parameters `(Object feature, Object context, String correlationId, User user)` that is commonly used in multiple methods across the `ScriptListener` and `DefaultScriptListener` classes. We can extract these parameters into a single class, which we'll call `ScriptEventContext`.","","First, let's create the `ScriptEventContext` class:","","```java","public class ScriptEventContext {","    private final Object feature;","    private final Object context;","    private final String correlationId;","    private final User user;","","    public ScriptEventContext(@NonNull Object feature, @CheckForNull Object context, @NonNull String correlationId, @CheckForNull User user) {","        this.feature = Objects.requireNonNull(feature, \"Feature cannot be null\");","        this.correlationId = Objects.requireNonNull(correlationId, \"CorrelationID cannot be null\");","        this.context = context;","        this.user = user;","    }","","    @NonNull","    public Object getFeature() {","        return feature;","    }","","    @CheckForNull","    public Object getContext() {","        return context;","    }","","    @NonNull","    public String getCorrelationId() {","        return correlationId;","    }","","    @CheckForNull","    public User getUser() {","        return user;","    }","}","```","","Now, let's refactor the `ScriptListener` interface:","","```java","public interface ScriptListener {","    // ...","","    default void onScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventContext eventContext) {","        // Implementation here","    }","","    default void onScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventContext eventContext) {","        // Implementation here","    }","","    // ...","","    static void fireScriptExecution(@CheckForNull String script, @CheckForNull Binding binding, @NonNull ScriptEventContext eventContext) {","        Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptExecution(script, binding, eventContext));","    }","","    static void fireScriptOutput(@CheckForNull String output, @NonNull ScriptEventContext eventContext) {","        Listeners.notify(ScriptListener.class, true, listener -> listener.onScriptOutput(output, eventContext));","    }","","    // ...","}","```","","Refactor the `ListenerWriter` and `OutputStream` anonymous classes:","","```java","public class ListenerWriter extends Writer {","    // Define other fields and methods...","","    private final ScriptEventContext eventContext;","","    public ListenerWriter(Writer writer, ScriptEventContext eventContext) {","        this.writer = writer;","        this.eventContext = eventContext;","    }","","    @Override","    public void write(@NonNull char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {","        ScriptListener.fireScriptOutput(String.copyValueOf(cbuf, off, len), eventContext);","        writer.write(cbuf, off, len);","    }","}","","public class OutputStream extends java.io.OutputStream {","    // Define other fields and methods...","","    private final ScriptEventContext eventContext;","","    public OutputStream(OutputStream os, Charset charset, ScriptEventContext eventContext) {","        this.os = os;","        this.charset = charset;","        this.eventContext = eventContext;","    }","","    // Implement other methods using eventContext instead of individual members","}","```","","Finally, let's update all the usages accordingly:","","```java","// In the calling code, you would create a ScriptEventContext instance like this:","ScriptEventContext eventContext = new ScriptEventContext(feature, context, correlationId, user);","","// And then you use it as a single parameter where required:","ScriptListener.fireScriptExecution(script, binding, eventContext);","ScriptListener.fireScriptOutput(output, eventContext);","```","","The calling code in `GroovyCommand`, `GroovyshCommand`, `RemotingDiagnostics`, and `GroovyHookScript` files would need to change to create and use `ScriptEventContext` instances instead of passing the individual parameters separately.
