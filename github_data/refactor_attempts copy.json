The method takes several parameters, but they are all related to the report and its execution context. This makes it easier to understand what the method does and how it works.","","In addition, we have extracted the common functionality of logging the report into a separate class, which helps reduce code duplication and improves maintainability. The `LogAction` class now has only one method that is responsible for logging the report information, making it easier to understand what the class does and how it works.","","Here's an example of how we can use this refactored code:","```java","// src/main/java/org/traccar/helper/LogActionTest.java","package org.traccar.helper;","","import java.text.DateFormat;","import java.util.Arrays;","import java.util.Date;","import java.util.List;","import org.junit.Test;","import static org.junit.Assert.*;","","public class LogActionTest {","","    @Test","    public void testLogReport() {","        DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\");","        List<Long> deviceIds = Arrays.asList(1L, 2L);","        List<Long> groupIds = Arrays.asList(3L, 4L);","        LogAction.logReport(10L, true, \"report\", new Date(), new Date(), deviceIds, groupIds);","    }","","}","```","In this example, we have a test method that calls the `LogAction.logReport()` method with some sample data. This helps ensure that the refactored code works as expected and makes it easier to test and maintain the code."],["[PYTHON]","# This script is based on the previous one, but it uses Python instead of

The first data clump is related to the parameters of the `create`, `edit`, and `remove` methods. These methods all have at least 3 common parameters: `userId`, `object`, and `id`.

and date range. It uses the Jxls library to generate an Excel report from a template file.","","Here's a brief overview of its main methods:","","1. `getObjects(long userId, Collection<Long> deviceIds, Collection<Long> groupIds, Collection<String> types, Date from, Date to)`: This method retrieves events for the given devices and groups within the specified date range that match the provided event types. It filters out events where geofences or maintenance items are not found in the user's accessible objects.","","2. `getExcel(OutputStream outputStream, long userId, Collection<Long> deviceIds, Collection<Long> groupIds, Collection<String> types, Date from, Date to)`: This method generates an Excel report containing event data similar to the one produced by the `getObjects()` method. It iterates through accessible devices, fetches their events within the given date range, and includes geofence names, maintenance names, and position details in the report.","","The class utilizes various utility methods from the `reportUtils` field to handle object retrieval, period validation, Excel template processing, and more. The `config` field holds configuration settings for the application."]],"0.1":[["## MARKDOWN","*** src/main/java/org/traccar/helper/LogAction.java","Java```java","import java.beans.Introspector;","import java.text.DateFormat;","import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;","import java.util.Date;","import java.util.List;","","import org.slf4j.Logger;","import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;","import org.traccar.model.BaseModel;","","public final class LogAction {","","    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LogAction.class);","","    private LogAction() {","    }","","    private static final String ACTION_CREATE = \"create\";","    private static final String ACTION_EDIT = \"edit\";","    private static final String ACTION_REMOVE = \"remove\";","","    private static final String ACTION_LINK = \"link\";","    private static final String ACTION_UNLINK = \"unlink\";","","    private static final String ACTION_LOGIN = \"login\";","    private static final String ACTION_LOGOUT = \"logout\";","","    private static final String ACTION_DEVICE_ACCUMULATORS = \"deviceAccumulators\";","","    private static final String PATTERN_OBJECT = \"%d %s %s %d\";","    private static final String PATTERN_LINK = \"%d %s %s %d %s %d\";","    private static final String PATTERN_LOGIN = \"%d %s %s\";","","    public static void logObjectAction(String action, long userId, Class<?> clazz, long objectId) {","        LOGGER.info(String.format(","                PATTERN_OBJECT, userId, action, Introspector.decapitalize(clazz.getSimpleName()), objectId));","    }","","    public static void logLinkAction(","            String action, long userId, Class<?> owner, long ownerId, Class<?> property, long propertyId) {","        LOGGER.info(String.format(","                PATTERN_LINK, userId, action,","                Introspector.decapitalize(owner.getSimpleName()), ownerId,","                Introspector.decapitalize(property.getSimpleName()), propertyId));","    }","","    public static void logLoginAction(String action, long userId, String remoteAddress) {","        if (remoteAddress == null || remoteAddress.isEmpty()) {","            remoteAddress = \"unknown\";","        }","        LOGGER.info(String.format(PATTERN_LOGIN, userId, action, remoteAddress));","    }","","    public static void logReport(","            long userId, boolean scheduled, String report,","            Date from, Date to, List<Long> deviceIds, List<Long> groupIds) {","        DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\");","        LOGGER.info(String.format(","                PATTERN_REPORT, userId, scheduled ?

The report is then written to the provided output stream in Excel format.","","The method uses various helper functions like `DeviceUtil.getAccessibleDevices`, `reportUtils.checkPeriodLimit`, `reportUtils.getObject`, and others from other parts of the system to retrieve event information, process templates with context variables, and manage data for the report generation."]]}}
